<i>The horoscope said that I should
go on a date this weekend.</i>

3
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,800
<i>Do you want to go with me?</i>

4
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,600
<i>- Our first date!
- If it rains, we should just cancel.</i>

5
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,800
<i>It worked!</i>

6
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,470
Using Cantor's diagonal argument
you are able to see that

7
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:41,940
infinity reaches beyond
natural numbers.

8
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,540
<i>Stop it!</i>

9
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:17,340
<i>Suicide just isn't the answer.</i>

10
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,600
<i>Didn't I say I was here for you?</i>

11
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,400
<i>That I'd always be by your side?</i>

12
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,800
<i>- Really?
- Really.</i>

13
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:31,290
<i>Darn! I almost had it too!</i>

14
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:10,100
<i>- I did it!</i>
- What?

15
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:14,500
It's the first time you called me!

16
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:22,640
Why would you do something like that
to someone who's worried about you?

17
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,900
I always wanted to try,
but I decided not to.

18
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,600
You thought it'd be a nuisance?

19
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:33,510
No. At the park you said you'd be
thinking about me all the time.

20
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:37,420
- Did I really say that?
- You said you promised!

21
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:40,550
Fine then... so why the problem?

22
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:43,060
I'm always the one
who calls you.

23
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:48,100
- Oh, the phone bill?
- That's not it!

24
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,870
Well... I guess there's a bit of that.

25
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:53,430
Next time just call and hang up.
I'll call you back.

26
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:57,570
- Thank you.
- No problem.

27
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:59,340
What was I trying to say again?

28
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:02,010
You said it's always you that calls.

29
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:05,410
Sorry I waited to see if
you'd call, but...

30
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,950
I was happy.

31
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:18,400
I'm not about to kill myself.

32
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:25,130
I'm more positive than before.

33
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:29,100
- Stop yawning.
- Go on then.

34
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:35,040
I don't know how long I have to live,
but there's lots I have left to do.

35
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,510
Stuff you haven't done yet?

36
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:40,810
Like eating really nice food.
You could pay for it.

37
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:42,080
Me?

38
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,020
And going places I've never been.

39
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,590
Also...

40
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:53,030
Oh! I forgot my phone!

41
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,930
- At my place?
- I think so.

42
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:59,000
We'll have to go back.

43
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,970
Just go ahead! We shouldn't be
at the station together anyway.

44
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:06,830
You're right. Here's the key.

45
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:10,000
I'll put it in your shoe box
at school.

46
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,800
Also...

47
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:21,760
The thing I want to do most...

48
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:27,390
<i>﻿At that time, there were differences
between us.</i>

49
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:33,600
<i>﻿Like that carefree positive
energy of hers.</i>

50
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,170
I...

51
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,110
I want to fall in love.

52
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:57,720
<i>I was always running
from the truth.</i>

53
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,570
I said it!

54
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,060
- Excuse me!
- Welcome.

55
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:39,500
I made a double!

There's no room for argument.

62
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:08,580
As Kudô Beniko's homeroom
teacher, I feel responsible.

63
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:11,750
There's nothing you could
have done.

64
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:17,220
Those things are left up
to Fujimura<i>-sensei.</i>

65
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,800
Expulsion is the only answer.

66
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,200
We must maintain the integrity
of the school.

67
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,100
What about the contributions?

68
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:26,900
The contributions her parents
make every year?

69
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,630
Are you sure this is the place
for that sort of talk?

70
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:31,400
Why not let me solve this problem?

71
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,400
But...

72
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,200
We won't bother the principal
about it just yet.

73
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,600
Thank you so much.

74
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,110
No problem.

75
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,500
The principal won't know,

76
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,700
and the money is important
to the school.

77
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,690
- Yes, but...
- Something else?

78
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:53,860
With the girl last year,
you didn't do anything.

79
00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:01,600
The same host has come back
for seconds at our school.

80
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:06,240
- Don't you find that strange?
- Yes, of course.

81
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,440
If they were girls
from good families,

82
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,980
they wouldn't be tricked so easily.

83
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:16,300
- Can't you see where he's going.
- Where?

84
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,380
He might have an insider
at the school.

85
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,620
He couldn't...

86
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:23,590
I doubt it too.
It's just a precaution.

87
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:27,730
If we don't stop this here,
it will just continue next year.

88
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:33,360
It's not that I'm giving Kudô
special treatment.

89
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,800
Understood. Excuse me.

90
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:45,640
You really think there could be...

91
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:49,480
...an insider? Not really.

92
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:53,100
I selected "continue".

93
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,400
The game.

VOL.5 "MAYONAKA NO TAIKETSU"

95
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:35,220
Stupid! Don't follow me.

96
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,800
- Ouch!
- Hina.

97
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,600
<i>The jewels?</i>

98
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,040
I can get good money for them
at the pawnshop.

99
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,010
You took them without asking.

100
00:08:56,010 --> 00:09:00,020
The money was earned by burying
dead people.

101
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:04,690
- Why say that?
- It's true.

102
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:08,320
But I'm surprised.

103
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,330
Even I'm surprised.

104
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:16,700
He told me he's never been
number one at anything.

105
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:24,640
Not school, not sports.
He looked so sad.

106
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:29,180
I understand him because
I'm the same.

107
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:32,350
Me too.

108
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:38,250
For girls its okay, but guys have
to go out into society.

109
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:42,360
Without confidence,
it's really hard, right?

110
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,000
I don't know.

111
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:50,400
But if I make him the top
seller at his club,

112
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,540
I know he'll quit for me.

113
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,800
I don't know about that.

114
00:09:56,510 --> 00:10:00,740
When I left it was out of pure adrenaline.

115
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:04,980
<i>I saw him standing out in the rain.</i>

116
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:11,550
I knew I'd get expelled, but I had
this amazing feeling.

117
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:14,690
You're not expelled.

118
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:18,460
The council decided you were
just suspended for now.

119
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:22,330
- You're joking?
- The head of the grade saved you.

120
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:25,370
Fujimura<i>-sensei?</i>

121
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:27,240
Really?

122
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,840
So you still have a chance
to go back.

123
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,510
If you say you were tricked.

124
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:37,010
If you say he's a horrible person.

125
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:41,700
- I'm going.
- Wait, Beni!

126
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:46,960
The more people condemn him
the more I love him.

127
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,430
I can make this work.

128
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:14,520
You... why?

129
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:19,990
Why do you keep being
so kind to me?

130
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:25,630
Kind? I thought that I was being
quite severe.

131
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:28,500
It's for my own good.

132
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,570
Do you remember
the group counseling?

133
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:33,400
Yes.

134
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:38,170
Other patients were able
to express themselves.

135
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:41,880
- They'd relate to each other.
- Yes.

136
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:47,820
You were different.
You barely spoke.

137
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,020
That's right.

138
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:56,230
I thought you were definitely
headed for suicide.

139
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:58,200
And then shortly after...

140
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:02,600
It's because I'm weak.

141
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:05,500
Yes. That's right.

142
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:14,640
I've told you about my husband
before, right?

143
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,710
He passed away of cancer, right?

144
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:22,620
He was also a weak person.

145
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,590
Very much.

146
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,390
- What is it?
- Nothing really.

147
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:06,730
I doubt it.

148
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:09,630
Why? What are you doing here?

149
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:12,870
Nothing really.

150
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:15,540
He's not there.

151
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:28,990
- You're late!
- So sorry!

152
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:32,050
<i>- Sensei!</i>
- A teacher?

153
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:36,330
Yeah. Right now I'm teaching math
at a girls school.

154
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:39,300
- My uncle a teacher?
- Your uncle?

155
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,600
She's a student of mine.

156
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,370
Oh! I thought she was
your whore.

157
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:46,670
Shut up!

158
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:52,010
He's my nephew,
my big brother's son.

159
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:54,040
Nephew?

160
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,510
I'm Koga Shôta.
Nice to meet you.

161
00:13:56,510 --> 00:14:00,520
- I'm Machida Hina.
- And what's she here for?

162
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,350
- What do you think of her?
- What do you mean?

163
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:05,400
Is she your type?

164
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:10,030
And how about you?

165
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,370
I get it.

166
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:26,710
What does he think he's doing?
Copying me?

167
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:45,630
And he walked you home?

168
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:47,860
Hello?

169
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:50,100
We parted at the station.

170
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:53,240
I told him to take you home.

171
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:57,270
- C'mon!
- What?

172
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,440
Is this because of what
I said this morning?

173
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,180
That's right. You said you wanted
to fall in love.

174
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,750
I did but...

175
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:10,790
<i>You said that you were being
very positive.</i>

176
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:13,920
But I figured you'll always
be down at times.

177
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:19,400
At times like that you don't want
to get desperate and go for anyone.

178
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,200
He's my nephew and if you
had him you wouldn't

179
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:26,640
<i>- be desperate like that.</i>
- I want real love.

180
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,770
Not you setting me up
with some guy.

181
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:34,410
Oh, I see.
He wasn't your type?

182
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:36,980
That's not the issue.

183
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:39,150
<i>He plays rugby</i>

184
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:42,350
and his marks are enough to get
into the top universities.

185
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:47,960
He's a pretty decent looking
guy too, right?

186
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:51,430
He gets lots of chocolate
on Valentine's Day apparently.

187
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:54,560
So why me, then?

188
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,830
<i>Oh, I get it.</i>

189
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:00,040
What?

190
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,910
You're more concerned
about yourself.

191
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:06,640
- Don't say that...
- I think he was into you.

192
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,640
And why is that?

193
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:12,720
He asked you for your e-mail
address, right?

194
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,900
So what?

195
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:18,520
Don't be modest.
You're a charming girl.

196
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,690
Really?

197
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:27,400
- Yeah.
- Your type?

198
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,930
I think so. I'll ask him.

199
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:33,940
<i>- Not him.</i>
- What?

200
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:38,540
- You?
- Me?

201
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:43,380
You took me home before
to sleep with me.

202
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:49,220
That was different. And you said
you were 20 and a stylist.

203
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:52,690
Strange guys will try
to pick you up.

204
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:54,500
And you're a strange guy.

205
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:58,290
Don't worry about me.

206
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:03,800
<i>I said l'd always look after you,
but I can't always be there.</i>

207
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:10,670
<i>So... I'm sorry I wasn't very
delicate introducing you.</i>

208
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:14,110
<i>- But I'm thinking of you when...</i>
- Idiot!

209
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:18,500
Hello?

210
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:20,800
Huh?

211
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:29,860
<i>This is an automated answering
machine.</i>

212
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:33,100
What's her problem?

213
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:57,450
- Good morning!
- Oh! Good morning!

214
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:05,460
- Um...
- Yes?

215
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:09,000
Is there like a male equivalent
to PMS?

216
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:17,510
Like wanting to be with someone
one day and alone the next?

217
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:19,440
I wonder. In my case...

218
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,380
You talk to Fujimura<i>-sensei</i>
a lot, right?

219
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:25,000
Well not that much.

220
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,750
- Could you...
- Yes?

221
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:33,120
Does my name ever come up?

222
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,990
Not really...

223
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:41,600
Fujimura<i>-sensei</i> kissed me.

224
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,470
What do you think?

225
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:47,000
I don't really know.

226
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,210
Would you ask him
for the truth?

227
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:52,240
Me?

228
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:02,220
- Class is starting!
- Okay!

229
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:11,960
When <i>a</i> and <i>c</i> aren't 1...

230
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:20,370
log <i>ab</i> = log <i>ca</i> / log <i>cb.</i>

231
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:24,910
The reason is that <i>P</i> =...

232
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:48,230
<i>P</i> = log <i>ab.</i>

233
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:20,030
Hello.

234
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:23,000
Hi.

235
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,180
Do you ever get dizzy?

236
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:36,400
Do you get tired easily?

237
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,220
Are these symptoms
of my illness?

238
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:43,400
- Headaches?
- Not yet.

239
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,890
Are you able to sleep?

240
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:52,300
It depends. Not last night.

241
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,070
They must be symptoms.

242
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:58,430
At your age, even little things
will make an impact.

243
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:01,540
- But...
- How is your appetite?

244
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:04,440
Strangely it's...

245
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:08,480
- Good to hear.
- Yes.

246
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,810
Poor you.

247
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:16,020
Just now you sounded a lot
like my teacher.

248
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,620
Koga<i>-kun?</i>

249
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:23,430
He said that to me before.
In a gentle way like that.

250
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:24,960
Really?

251
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:30,500
It makes me feel better.

252
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,370
Is he kind to you?

253
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:36,210
Sometimes he is and sometimes
he isn't.

254
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:40,440
- Sometimes he isn't?
- He's just a bit moody.

255
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:44,100
That's horrible, considering he
knows about your illness.

256
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:47,020
I guess.

257
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:49,450
And it makes you uneasy.

258
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:53,890
I am uneasy at times.

259
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:58,260
I feel like when he's kind to me
I feel fine

260
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:02,030
and when he's cold with me
I feel uneasy.

261
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:05,070
Depending on somebody
is natural.

262
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:07,500
- Depending?
- Right.

263
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:12,210
You feel like he's the only one
who understands you?

264
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:17,880
Is dependence different from love?

265
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:22,050
I think about him all the time,
but...

266
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:27,290
...it's different. It's an illusion.

267
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:30,160
Thinking like that will just
make you sad.

268
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,530
- Sad?
- Don't you think?

269
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:36,200
Even if you think that way
about him,

270
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:39,170
how does he think about you?

271
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:44,040
He's a teacher and you're a student.
And he's much older.

272
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:48,280
Basically, he's nice to you because
of your illness.

273
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:54,180
Even if he's sympathetic,
that isn't love.

274
00:22:56,150 --> 00:23:01,260
Think about how he feels.

275
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:08,530
I understand how you feel.
It must be hard.

276
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:13,900
But if you really want to fall in love...

277
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:23,150
...you must do it with somebody that
doesn't know about your illness.

278
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,620
My feelings for him are an illusion.

279
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,850
Yes.

280
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:36,760
And it's just a feeling and not love.

281
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:40,700
I must be a real idiot.

282
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:45,970
I'm sorry to talk to you this way.

283
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:47,600
It's okay.

284
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:51,310
Anyway, I'll give you some medicine.

285
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:53,340
Okay.

286
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:07,830
Koga<i>-san!</i>

287
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:11,830
Koga Shôta<i>-san</i>?

288
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:17,800
Hey!

289
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:26,000
I went overboard in sports today.

290
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:35,420
Wow! Your room is so empty.

291
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:39,200
- Told you so!
- All you have is a TV!

292
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,120
I don't like hanging around
at home.

293
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,360
Even so...

294
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,300
Answer the phone. One of your
customers, right?

295
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,600
Nah. Don't worry.

296
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,300
I'm not going to get bothered
by something like that.

297
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,510
I know what your job is.

298
00:24:56,510 --> 00:25:00,440
Sorry. Just give me a second.

299
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,810
Yes?

300
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:08,300
- Tonight's on schedule.
<i>- What was it again?</i>

301
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:12,560
I told you about that person
I wanted you to meet.

302
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:16,490
Oh! The math teacher, right?

303
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:18,630
Do you really think it'll work?

304
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:23,600
Trust me. I was right about
the other girl, right?

305
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,470
You got me there.

306
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:33,010
I have a gift for noticing people
with borderline personalities.

307
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:36,780
- See you later.
- Sure.

308
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:05,070
What are you guys doing here?

309
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:11,480
- Yûji!
- Get over here!

310
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,720
He owes us money!

311
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:18,250
You're his girlfriend, right?
You pay us back...

312
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:22,020
...with your body!

313
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:25,090
Yûji! Yûji!

314
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:42,340
- Stop it! Please!
- Shut up!

315
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:39,340
What did you throw away?

316
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:42,000
Dependence.

317
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,200
Nothing.

318
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:52,980
What should we do after eating?

319
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:55,320
Did my teacher tell you
to do this?

320
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:59,800
- What?
- To look after me or something?

321
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:03,060
Are you a princess or something?

322
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:05,300
Yes, I am.

323
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:08,460
Tejima<i>-sensei</i> said that?

324
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:11,370
She said she wants to know
the truth.

325
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:15,300
- I'm sorry.
- No problem.

326
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:21,510
There are two opposite things
I tend to look for in women.

327
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:26,950
On the one hand I like wholesome,
well-spirited women.

328
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:31,020
On the other hand understanding
each other is important.

329
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:36,160
Not even that, it's emotion
that's important.

330
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:44,000
Someone who shares my abnormal
level of emotional depth.

331
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,440
The wholesome person would be
Tejima<i>-sensei</i>, right?

332
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:55,650
But when I try for a woman like that,
I feel my spirit drying up.

333
00:28:55,650 --> 00:29:03,390
The second type of girl isn't
Kudô Beniko, is it?

334
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:09,860
It's sad how easily she can fall into
the lap of somebody like that.

335
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:14,300
And you don't want to save her
because you're a teacher, but...

336
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:19,400
I'm not sure if it's that I want
to save her or just be with her

337
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:22,100
when she's down like this.

338
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:26,440
Sorry for bringing you along.

339
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:30,710
Just tell Tejima<i>-sensei</i> what
you have to.

340
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:35,200
- I'm not sure if I can.
- I'm counting on you.

341
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:42,360
I'll be heading out then.

342
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:04,850
- I'll kill them!
- Stop!

343
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:08,950
Your debt is cleared, right?

344
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:10,700
Beniko.

345
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:15,400
I'm fine.

346
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:28,440
I'm so sorry!

347
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,730
It's so close! C'mon!
You can do it!

348
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:03,710
- You did it!
- Here.

349
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:08,200
- Thanks! Look at it!
- Stop it.

350
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:46,080
- What are you doing?
- Excuse me, I forgot my key...

351
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:50,120
- Good evening.
- You?

352
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:55,460
Here we are.

353
00:31:56,530 --> 00:32:01,260
Right on. Let's start the game.

354
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:04,130
Die!

355
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:15,110
Hey!

356
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:19,880
<i>Sensei?</i>

357
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:25,190
You're still here? Run! Quickly!

358
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:28,620
Stop it!

359
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:32,000
No need to worry.

360
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:39,900
What are you doing here so late?

361
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:45,170
Forgot something?
Your key, perhaps?

362
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:48,610
- What is this about?
- Don't be angry.

363
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:52,180
I told you I wanted us
to get together.

364
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:56,290
I want you to be my friend.

365
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:58,500
So you were the insider?

366
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:03,130
I'm good at spotting weak people.

367
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:04,430
What do you mean?

368
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:09,270
Relax! I'm going to show
you paradise.

369
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:12,700
I want paradise too!

370
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:16,270
Life shouldn't be boring.

371
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:18,840
We're fed up with what society
has dealt us.

372
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:22,210
We don't want to be the horse
pulling the cart.

373
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:26,580
We want to be the ones sitting
on top, enjoying the view.

374
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:31,390
It's easy to take control.

375
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:36,160
Forget about morals. Just put
doubt behind you and go for it.

376
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:39,030
Do what you want without
any worries.

377
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:42,060
Think of it like a game.

378
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:45,300
Sorry, but I don't want
to be like that.

379
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,870
No way!

380
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:50,440
You said yourself you don't believe
in all that eternity crap.

381
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:54,210
That's not the same.

382
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:58,850
I took the janitor out from behind
with this bat.

383
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:03,950
He didn't see our faces
and we're all wearing gloves.

384
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:07,020
If you hold this bat, you become
the prime suspect.

385
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:14,360
They'll think you did it because you
were new and the pressure built up.

386
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:23,040
How foolish.

387
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,410
Great. Now you're with us.

388
00:34:26,410 --> 00:34:31,410
If you don't cooperate we'll leave
you here till morning.

389
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:37,250
I'll call in to the cops anonymously.

390
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:44,130
Don't try anything.
We're too strong.

391
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:50,130
Please, <i>Sensei</i>. Just give up
and come over to us.

392
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:56,740
Let's have fun. You never know
when you're going to die, right?

393
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:04,150
You try too! It feels great.

394
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:07,050
Think of the window as this
despicable society.

395
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:10,400
Break everything!

396
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:23,100
- Do it!
- Do it!

397
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:36,380
Way to go!

398
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:47,390
Keep it coming!

399
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:51,890
If you're gonna break one,
might as well break more!

400
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:22,500
- Here's half.
- Thanks.

401
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,400
Damn! I missed.

402
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,000
I missed again!

403
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:01,000
<i>We won!</i>

404
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:06,100
Not again!

405
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:21,780
What?

406
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:32,060
Hey!

407
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:37,930
Sorry. I'm going home.

408
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:46,810
It's not everyday I can play chess
with a math teacher.

409
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:50,850
So let's make it worth something.

410
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:53,250
If you win, I'll let you go.

411
00:37:53,250 --> 00:38:00,000
- Yûji.
- Shut up. The winner gets a prize.

412
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:22,140
It's so cold.

413
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:30,650
- Everything is girl's stuff.
- It's a girls school after all.

414
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:33,390
Oh! I found some gym clothes.

415
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:37,090
- Take a whiff of those, man!
- Stop it, perverts!

416
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:07,390
Stop it! Just take it home.

417
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:12,660
They should really mind
their manners.

418
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:21,070
Hold me close and hold me fast.

419
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:24,110
The magic spell you cast.

420
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:28,880
This is <i>la vie en rose.</i>

421
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:33,020
When you kiss me, heaven sighs.

422
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,880
And though I close my eyes.

423
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:45,430
Maybe he's asleep.

424
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:01,500
It worked!

425
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:05,100
Obviously.

426
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Sensei?

427
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:46,390
You guys go home.

428
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:48,360
Do what you're told.

429
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:51,690
Tetsuya, keep watch out front.

430
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:54,400
Sure thing.

431
00:40:58,770 --> 00:41:00,840
Good luck, <i>Sensei!</i>

432
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,470
Hey! Don't you want him
to become one of us?

433
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:06,070
True. Okay, bye.

434
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:14,020
You used to work
for the government, right?

435
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:17,150
An elite engineer.

436
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:22,260
Mathematicians and physicists
always impressed me.

437
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:28,700
Nobel invented TNT. Oppenheimer
invented the atomic bomb.

438
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:36,870
Geniuses are really good
at destroying the world.

439
00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:19,420
Looking for this?

440
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:23,800
- Please!
- When we finish the game.

441
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,400
It's a toy.

442
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:48,010
I know a lot about medicine.

443
00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:53,750
You could say I'm a distributor.

444
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:59,890
I suppose it's natural not to believe
in the afterlife.

445
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:03,000
You won't be around much longer.

446
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,700
Checkmate.

447
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:16,100
Congratulations.
