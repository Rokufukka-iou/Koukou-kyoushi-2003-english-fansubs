"KÔKÔ KYÔSHI"

3
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:14,570
- Here!
- Thanks.

4
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:17,370
We'll come back
for the container.

5
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:27,120
You're a lucky man.

6
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,120
The students don't care as long
as you're young and single.

7
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,600
- Aren't you young and single?
- Oh, that's right!

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,860
Don't feel like you have
to eat it all.

9
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,300
It's a women's trap. If you get fat
they won't give you a second look.

10
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:53,710
- Tejima<i>-sensei?</i>
- Yes.

11
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,950
Take a look at this.

12
00:00:57,950 --> 00:00:59,780
Thank you.

13
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,420
This is really good.

14
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:07,856
- What is it?
- Oh...

15
00:01:07,856 --> 00:01:09,190
Nothing.

16
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:29,220
I messed it up.

17
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:33,920
<i>I wanted a secret all
for myself.</i>

18
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,120
<i>But if the only person that shares
that secret with me...</i>

19
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:41,430
<i>...doesn't remember it,
there's no point.</i>

20
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:44,860
<i>I'm happy that you
remembered.</i>

21
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,800
He helped me get away
from that pervert.

22
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,600
I get it!

23
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,000
And you wanted to thank
him for that.

24
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:01,970
Wait!

25
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:08,810
I think I'm having my period!

26
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:22,300
<i>If you don't mind,
why not spend the night?</i>

27
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,700
<i>Just to sleep.</i>

28
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,900
<i>Can't you just sleep beside
me tonight?</i>

29
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,700
<i>It's my one wish
in my whole life.</i>

30
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,740
<i>I'm going to die soon.</i>

31
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,810
I got hungry watching
you eat.

32
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,320
- Here.
- Really?

33
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:49,220
- I made a lot.
- All right, then.

34
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:04,100
You didn't put any poison
in this, did you?

35
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,720
<i>At that point I was torturing
myself inside.</i>

36
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,220
- Prank call?
- No.

37
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,480
It's my girlfriend.

38
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:25,127
Are you in love?

39
00:03:25,127 --> 00:03:28,992
<i>The more important something
was, the worse I acted.</i>

40
00:03:28,992 --> 00:03:31,910
<i>It was like a big joke.</i>

41
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,760
Hello, darling!

42
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:40,270
Sure, let's meet up.
Where is good?

43
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,940
That's right.

44
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,900
They're meeting at that
café "Peach".

VOL.2: "SENSEI NO
HIMITSU"

50
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,700
Solve this if I call
your number.

51
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:24,000
Five minutes should do.

52
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:26,100
Doesn't this kinda suck?

53
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:31,400
Numbers 14, 15, 16 come
to the front.

54
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,860
Damn! I'm number 16.

55
00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:00,620
<i>To be honest, the students
don't like your class.</i>

56
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:01,700
Understood.

57
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:05,130
All you do is write problems
and make the students solve them.

58
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:06,800
Trying to cut corners,
are you?

59
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,800
Obviously you're just trying to gauge
the level of the students, right?

60
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,270
Math is about repetition
and speed.

61
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:18,820
So you're doing
it on purpose?

62
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,350
Unlike memorization,

63
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:24,950
math and geometry require
actual talent.

64
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:28,850
For kids without that talent,
numbers will just put them to sleep.

65
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:32,120
We're not here to train
rocket scientists.

66
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,320
That's right.

67
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,060
It's not like I have any Olympic
athletes to teach.

68
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:40,800
We're here to allow students
to advance to university.

69
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,630
The most important thing is to make
sure no girls fall through the cracks.

70
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:49,900
- But that's so...
- Boring?

71
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:55,400
In that case,
maybe you should quit.

72
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,970
Excuse me.

73
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:05,020
Hey, who do you think
you are?

74
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:09,060
- I'm really sorry.
- Koga<i>-sensei?</i>

75
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,670
Hey there.

76
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,980
Don't you have class?

77
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:35,890
I have a review block and I saw you
coming here from the window.

78
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:38,250
Are you training with
the team today?

79
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:41,560
- I'm busy.
- To bad.

80
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,760
I was thinking of going too.

81
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,460
Why?

82
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:50,330
What do you mean?
Are you really asking?

83
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:52,260
Weren't you mad at me?

84
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,100
Because you pushed me away
after I kissed you?

85
00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:00,110
I'm shy like that.

86
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,500
Maybe I came back to you precisely
because I was mad.

87
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,700
Sounds complicated.

88
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:10,610
It's simple. My boyfriend and I have
no spark right now, and no...

89
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:13,110
Why not break up, then?

90
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,000
If only I could find a new
boyfriend, then yes.

91
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,100
He'd ask why we were breaking up
and I wouldn't have an answer.

92
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,220
Just tell him there's
somebody else.

93
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:24,690
And there's no reply
for that.

94
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,570
How cruel.

95
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:30,470
It's worse to pretend to be nice.

96
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:33,430
You toy with people's
emotions that way.

97
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:37,100
Already looking
for the next victim?

98
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,810
Isn't this cute?

99
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:41,910
- That's so adorable!
- I'll take this!

100
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:43,770
Hey, wait!

101
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,980
When are you gonna be done
over there?

102
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:06,100
Today's history class will
be long, so let's...

103
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,200
What were you laughing
at back there?

104
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:12,230
- Huh?
- In the classroom.

105
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:17,250
- Nothing really.
- Okay, I'm done.

106
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,940
That's so gross,
you two holding hands.

107
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,400
What is it?

108
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:27,400
You said we were
best friends?

109
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,800
Yeah.

110
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,500
Oh... I'm sorry.

111
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,900
- Jealous?
- Shut up!

112
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,230
Beniko!

113
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:51,300
Hey, Kudô!
Where are you going?

114
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:55,000
- Where did she go?
- HYÛGA JOSHI

115
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,850
Now she's ignoring me?

116
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:18,500
- Yes?
<i>- Hello? It's me.</i>

117
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,600
- PEACH
- Welcome.

118
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,080
She's beautiful.

119
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,520
Welcome.

120
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,370
Go ahead.

121
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:56,010
- A <i>café au lait.</i>
- Understood.

122
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:00,680
- So it was true.
- What?

123
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:04,620
- That you became a teacher.
- Yeah.

124
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:08,350
- Do you know how to teach?
- Apparently not.

125
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:10,990
- That's not good.
- I guess.

126
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:17,890
Why?

127
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,100
About quitting my job?

128
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,800
You said you enjoyed the quiet
setting of your job.

129
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,000
And you talked about not having
to bother with lots of people.

130
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I said that.

131
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:32,400
You vanished from work
for a month.

132
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,400
What were you doing?

133
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:38,010
I was confused.
I'm back on my feet now.

134
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:46,190
I'm not criticizing you, but why
couldn't you have talked to me?

135
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,700
I figured you'd object.

136
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,790
My wages are a lot lower
after all.

137
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:53,430
That's what it was?

138
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:57,200
And that...

139
00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:01,030
...that was the reason you stopped
talking to me?

140
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:03,140
Well...

141
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:06,800
I was very worried.
Don't you understand that?

142
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,900
Worried?

143
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:11,080
Of course! You left your apartment
and your office empty.

144
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,300
And you wouldn't answer
my phone calls.

145
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,100
I did today, right?

146
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,100
How many times do you
think I called?

147
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,560
Exactly 100.

148
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,500
- I waited 'till the 100th time.
- Stop joking around.

149
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,130
Tell me what happened.

150
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,630
What is there to say?

151
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:31,570
There's something different
about you.

152
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:33,600
Maybe I'm a clone.

153
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,340
Be serious.

154
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:43,750
We even talked of marriage.
We met each other's parents.

155
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:47,500
Tell me the truth.

156
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,700
- The truth?
- What is it?

157
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:02,130
Welcome.

158
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:10,340
Nice to meet you.

159
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,480
Who's this?

160
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:26,440
At times like this,
men can never talk straight.

161
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:29,700
I'm sure he's just trying
to be nice.

162
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,930
- Times like this?
- Yes.

163
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:36,860
But to leave it at that doesn't help.
You need to know the truth.

164
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:39,290
About you two?

165
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:41,660
It's not that I don't like
you anymore.

166
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:44,610
Stop it with that.

167
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:50,450
I'm very sorry.
I didn't mean to...

168
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:52,250
There's nothing
to apologize for.

169
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,600
I'll pay.

170
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,590
Your wages are lower now,
right?

171
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:03,130
- It's okay.
- Thanks, then.

172
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:47,200
I want to show you something.
They only have it here.

173
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,240
All right, then.

174
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,670
This escalator goes up.

175
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,710
What is it?

176
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:00,000
He's my teacher. I don't think
he noticed though.

177
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,380
What? Is love forbidden
at your school?

178
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,920
I ditched school today.

179
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,900
<i>I know that girl.</i>

180
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:10,850
<i>Did you know she committed
suicide?</i>

181
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:14,200
<i>I'm sorry!</i>

182
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,200
JAPAN WOMEN'S MEDICAL

183
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,730
Couldn't you have dumped her
over the phone?

184
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:20,500
I didn't want to do it like that.

185
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:25,200
You actually made a student
pretend to be your girlfriend?

186
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,790
I figured it would go down
better that way.

187
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:29,500
She probably knows
it's not true.

188
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,430
But the girl's acting was great.

189
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,140
I wonder...

190
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:37,710
Women have good intuition.
It's odd that she gave up so easily.

191
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:41,200
Maybe it was a matter of pride.

192
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,600
You obviously just wanted
to meet her.

193
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,230
To meet her one last time -
or will it be the last time?

194
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:51,600
I bet you thought about telling
the truth, too.

195
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:56,800
You wanted to cry, confess
and be comforted.

196
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:58,700
That's not true.

197
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,300
You wanted her to look through
your silly charade

198
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,370
- and ask what's really wrong.
- You're wrong!

199
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:06,900
If you picked up after she called
enough, you'll probably confess

200
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:10,450
- if she asks enough.
- So what should I do?

201
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,960
I'm sorry.

202
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:23,890
It's okay to be honest
with me.

203
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,360
But only with me.

204
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,230
Okay.

205
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,470
Have a seat.

206
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:01,200
Good morning,
Koga<i>-sensei!</i>

207
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:33,060
Here, <i>"Ashibiki no yamadori no
o no shidari o no".</i>

208
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,900
It's known as <i>naganagashi.</i>

209
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:39,800
It represents a lonely bird
sleeping on its own.

210
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,400
Does everybody
understand?

211
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,470
- Okay, moving on...
- Wait!

212
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,720
What are you timing?

213
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:59,220
Nothing really.
Just makes me look busy.

214
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,930
Any word from your
girlfriend?

215
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:07,600
Thanks to your amazing
acting, none.

216
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:11,370
- Are you thankful?
- Yeah.

217
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,730
You do remember our agreement,
don't you?

218
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:18,400
You want to break up with your
boyfriend and it's my turn

219
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,380
to play the new love interest.

220
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:22,340
Right.

221
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:29,720
Sorry, but it's not gonna
happen.

222
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,750
What?

223
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:34,960
Is a teacher allowed
to break promises?

224
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:38,690
Now I'm a teacher?

225
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:46,300
- You seem to be fitting in.
- Not really.

226
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:49,070
I heard from the head
teacher.

227
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:53,040
You're resigning?

228
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,800
KUDÔ

229
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,560
It's huge.

230
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:18,260
I got it!
Stop it, Pooh<i>-san!</i>

231
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:20,540
Pooh<i>-san?</i>

232
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:25,210
Hi!

233
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:32,780
He's looks like a bear,
like Winnie-the-Pooh, right? So...

234
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:36,040
- Pooh<i>-san?</i>
- Yeah.

235
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:39,460
You're house is really big!
I'm surprised.

236
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,990
- Isn't it gross?
- No.

237
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:45,030
I was bullied when
I was younger.

238
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:48,060
Really? You seem more
like the type...

239
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,770
To bully someone?

240
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:53,170
Ah... yeah.

241
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:56,280
My family is in the funeral
business.

242
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,040
Funerals?

243
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:01,100
Kids said I was happy when
people died and called me

244
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,280
a zombie and stuff.

245
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:08,550
So I took a lot of time off school
and ended up a year behind.

246
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:13,720
You're different
from the rumors.

247
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:19,160
I have a habit
of victimizing myself.

248
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:25,600
I always take things that people
say the wrong way.

249
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:30,910
I feel like my friends aren't really
my friends.

250
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:36,600
I think maybe my teachers
or parents are just asking them

251
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,800
to hang out with me.

252
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,990
Stuff like that.

253
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:46,100
It happened for real once.

254
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,900
My parents paid some kid
to hang out with me.

255
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:54,400
I threw that person's flowers
back in their face.

256
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:58,700
I'm not saying that you're
like that.

257
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,260
I... get it.

258
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:06,400
And, I'm really jealous
of others.

259
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:10,350
I'm sorry.

260
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:13,100
Don't worry!
I'm just a little bit different.

261
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,300
My love is strong.

262
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:19,960
Saying it myself is kind
of funny.

263
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,620
I'm your friend.

264
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:27,160
I really like you a lot.

265
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:32,500
- Really?
- Yeah.

266
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,680
Let's always be best
friends.

267
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,260
What's wrong?

268
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:06,030
Don't worry.

269
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:16,280
You, too, Pooh<i>-san.</i>

270
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:21,650
We're very much alike.

271
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,550
Pooh<i>-san.</i>

272
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:28,320
<i>I thought I told you to come
to me about anything.</i>

273
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:33,330
If you don't talk to me,
we can't work this out.

274
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,130
I'm sorry.

275
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:39,870
If it has to do with your health,
that's one thing.

276
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:47,040
But leaving so soon is bad
for the students, too.

277
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:52,110
That's my official comment,
anyway.

278
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,050
You were an elite
civil servant.

279
00:22:57,050 --> 00:23:02,720
I know that my comments about
your class must have offended you.

280
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:06,060
That's not it.

281
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:08,690
That's not the problem?

282
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:10,870
No.

283
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:17,010
It's just that I don't think
I was meant to be a teacher.

284
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:20,090
You don't have the determination
to do it?

285
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:22,240
Right.

286
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:27,430
Who does have the determination
these days?

287
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:30,990
Everyone just wants to appease
everyone else.

288
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:33,800
Everyone is trying not
to offend anyone.

289
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,100
It used to be different.

290
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:47,840
Students aren't looking for those
determined teachers anymore.

291
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:52,810
- What about you?
- Huh?

292
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:55,050
I mean,
what about you, sir?

293
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:59,480
I'm probably less cut out to be
a teacher than you.

294
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,250
- I don't really think so.
- You don't?

295
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,990
I'm wearing a mask,
you see.

296
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:09,220
A mask?

297
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:15,400
A steel mask.

298
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:23,070
I don't remember what I really
look like anymore.

299
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,340
Lost to resignation
and idleness.

300
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,650
- Welcome back.
- Thanks.

301
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:47,000
- Hi there.
<i>- Kanpai!</i>

302
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:50,000
Isn't this place expensive?

303
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,100
It's only 3000 yen for your
first time.

304
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,410
Maybe that's too much
for you two?

305
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:55,870
Sorry! I don't drink.

306
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:58,780
A little won't hurt.
Let's make a toast.

307
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:01,110
Come on, Hina, just one.

308
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:06,750
- Okay, then.
- Sorry! Just wait a second.

309
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:11,990
<i>Where did you meet
this guy?</i>

310
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:15,520
<i>I was a bit shocked to hear
he was a host.</i>

311
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:19,400
Don't worry.
He's not ripping me off.

312
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,400
I don't have that
kind of cash.

313
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:31,640
Tired?

314
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,180
You can go home early
if you want.

315
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,280
Grade 11, class B,
Kudô Beniko.

316
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:45,050
Do you know her?

317
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:48,230
No.

318
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:52,730
It's possible that she's being targeted
by the host from the other day.

319
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:57,170
Remember what happened
to the last girl.

320
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:03,940
What passion you have.

321
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,810
I'm not interested
in the students.

322
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:13,050
<i>It's the host with those glassy
eyes that scared me.</i>

323
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,080
<i>Glassy eyes?</i>

324
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:18,520
<i>- He has no heart.</i>
- By credit card?

325
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:24,790
Thanks for today.
It was fun.

326
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:27,930
Look at this!

327
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:30,150
Hina, watch out! Run!

328
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:31,670
Stop!

329
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,340
Wait!

330
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:43,050
- Get the students.
- Understood.

331
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:51,750
My favorite teacher.
Thanks for always.

332
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:58,030
Hurry up, Hina!

333
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,400
This way!

334
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:08,200
What the hell.

335
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:38,030
You've been drinking?

336
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,500
I feel sick.

337
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:54,480
Here.

338
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:59,220
If I go home like this,
I'll get in trouble.

339
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:04,230
- I am your teacher, though.
- Huh?

340
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:08,060
Oh, nothing. Open it.

341
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:31,490
You found my address through
the school?

342
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:34,610
Should you really be bringing
students home?

343
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:37,460
Guilty as charged.

344
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:40,590
The girl from before
was a student, too?

345
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:41,770
No, she was...

346
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:45,230
I could tell how old she was.

347
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:50,970
You made it all up.
I thought a lot after that.

348
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:54,310
There was no way you'd do
something like that.

349
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:58,400
- You overestimate me.
- No, I don't.

350
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:02,580
That's why I thought
of marrying you.

351
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:06,320
I don't pick people
who make me worry.

352
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,900
You always liked stability.

353
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:13,830
It's not just that.
I understand you very well.

354
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:20,570
You're delicate and kind.
I respect you for that.

355
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:23,440
And I'm thankful for that.

356
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:27,480
So I knew that it wasn't true.

357
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,410
What do you want me
to say?

358
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:31,640
Tell me the truth.

359
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,840
About why I changed
my job?

360
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,320
Forget about that.
I trust your decision.

361
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:40,960
What is it, then?

362
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,360
Tell me why you're trying
to leave me.

363
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:50,330
That was also my decision.

364
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:52,540
Don't you have
an explanation?

365
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:55,770
It's really abstract.

366
00:29:55,770 --> 00:30:00,710
Basically, a lot of little things
put together.

367
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:08,380
I realized that our values
are different.

368
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:13,790
Did I try to force my values
upon you?

369
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:18,200
Neither of us did.
We just put up with each other.

370
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,500
And that added up?

371
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,500
I got bored of doing things
like having to socialize

372
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,300
with your parents.

373
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:29,770
I'm not good at that kind
of stuff.

374
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:35,720
- And so...
- I guess I wanted to escape.

375
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:38,770
Escape to a world where
nobody knew me.

376
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:42,950
And I chased you.
I don't give up easily.

377
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:45,190
No comment.

378
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:48,500
I did it because I love you.

379
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:56,000
- Love?
- Of course.

380
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:03,870
I love you.

381
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:07,190
And...

382
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:08,980
Love means understanding.

383
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:13,580
You didn't understand me.
You couldn't have loved me.

384
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:22,590
I'm sure I was the right kind
of man to marry.

385
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:29,570
But that alone doesn't make
a relationship.

386
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:32,470
Why are you being
so horrible?

387
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:35,670
Tell me! Why?

388
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:43,710
I can't believe that you'd say
such a thing to me.

389
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:51,190
I don't love you anymore.

390
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:58,660
I don't love you.

391
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,800
Oh.

392
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:23,620
Goodbye.

393
00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:00,860
Farkas was a Romanian teacher
of mathematics.

394
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:04,690
He was dedicated to proving
the fifth postulate.

395
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:08,800
At the same time his son
was thinking of non-Euclidean

396
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,490
geometry principles.

397
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:14,810
In a letter he wrote to his son
about how futile it was.

398
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:17,730
He told his son,
"Trust me and give up."

399
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:20,940
Love is the same.

400
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:27,700
Your health, your peace of mind
and your happiness

401
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,800
go out the window.

402
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:35,870
Would you just go home?

403
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,800
Go!

404
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:07,290
Excuse me.

405
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:18,400
I think... that he is still...

406
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,900
Well...

407
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:27,180
It's just a hunch.

408
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:30,280
Thanks.

409
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:32,850
No problem.

410
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:25,670
Goodbye.

411
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:32,940
<i>- Really? You got caught?</i>
- I'm sorry.

412
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:37,080
It's no big deal. We won't get
expelled or anything.

413
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:41,600
Don't tell anyone, but my parents
make a big financial contribution

414
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,350
to the school.

415
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:44,990
Really?

416
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:47,420
This world revolves
around money.

417
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:50,390
- Money?
- So don't worry about it.

418
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:52,750
Hey, you two over there!

419
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:55,900
- Start moving!
- Sorry!

420
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:06,040
<i>I love you.</i>

421
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:10,680
<i>- I don't love you anymore.</i>
- Hina!

422
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:18,520
Are you okay?
Machida, talk to me!

423
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,690
Did you hit your head?
Get up slowly.

424
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:23,230
I'm okay.

425
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:26,700
In the end I lost them
in the crowd.

426
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:29,520
Anyway, it might not have
been them.

427
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,320
Are you saying that I saw
things wrong?

428
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:36,620
- Oh... no.
- I'll let it go this time.

429
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:38,970
I'm not trying to protect
the students.

430
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:41,380
There is one condition.

431
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,600
I didn't hand in your letter
of resignation.

432
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,500
Give it another chance.

433
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:52,050
- Wait.
- Yes?

434
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:54,140
Why?

435
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:56,190
Why am I stopping you
from leaving?

436
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:59,800
- Yeah.
- Because I'm your boss.

437
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:05,270
<i>Stand. Bow.</i>

438
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:10,410
- Sit.
- Open page 136.

439
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,710
Hina?

440
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:16,150
- Are you okay?
- What's wrong?

441
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:18,980
She hit her head earlier
in gym class.

442
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:34,560
<i>Sensei.</i> I'm okay now.

443
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:38,000
Lets just make sure.

444
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:43,680
Maybe I'll get really smart,
like you.

445
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:48,100
- I'm stupid.
- Why is that?

446
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:53,320
Because you broke up with such
a beautiful woman?

447
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:58,200
I bet you were in love
at first.

448
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,320
Yeah.

449
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:06,430
But that feeling just started
to go away?

450
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:13,570
It's scary that either yourself or your
partner could end up like that.

451
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:17,780
And you?

452
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:20,660
I haven't had that kind
of experience yet.

453
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:24,810
I haven't loved or hated.

454
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:27,950
I see.

455
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:37,330
But when I'm in love,
I wanted it to last forever.

456
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:40,730
Never changing.

457
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,410
But I'm sure you wanted that
for yourself as well.

458
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:50,590
Who knows.

459
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:56,140
Of course you did. Nobody tries
to hate somebody on purpose.

460
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:07,500
We did a CT scan to be safe,
but the doctor said

461
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,230
there was no problem.

462
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:12,230
- Thank you.
- How are you?

463
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:14,730
Would you like to rest
for a bit longer?

464
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:17,000
- I'm ready to go.
- Wait a minute.

465
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,840
I'll go tell Fujimura<i>-sensei.</i>
Excuse me.

466
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:28,110
Is Koga<i>-sensei</i> here?

467
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:30,050
- The person you were with?
- Yes.

468
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:33,220
I think he's in the examination
room.

469
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:37,050
Do you ever have
double vision?

470
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:38,090
Yeah.

471
00:39:38,090 --> 00:39:42,220
It's also called polyopia,
and it's taking effect.

472
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:46,860
It's due to the growth
of the brain tumor.

473
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:51,000
What kind of symptoms
should I expect?

474
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,850
Well...

475
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:56,800
Rock, paper, scissors!
Look this way!

476
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,780
- I won!
- Darn, I lost.

477
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:02,460
- Daddy, l won! Bye-bye!
- Bye-bye!

478
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:05,520
<i>Brainstem glioma is a horrible
kind of tumor.</i>

479
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:10,430
The brainstem is the most
important part of the brain.

480
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:14,560
The brainstem controls
consciousness and breathing.

481
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:19,700
You should already be experiencing
polyopia and moderate loss

482
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,500
of motor control.

483
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:25,370
<i>The disease will continue
to worsen.</i>

484
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:29,000
<i>Eventually you won't be able
to move how you want</i>

485
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,300
<i>and breathing will become
difficult.</i>

486
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:36,980
- What about the life expectancy?
- What?

487
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:42,520
Only five percent of patients
of this disease survive.

488
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:47,950
Even with surgery, there is only
a small chance of success.

489
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:49,630
How long?

490
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:53,560
It's horrible, but it afflicts
young people the most.

491
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:58,930
I'd say six months at most.

492
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:05,010
Really?

493
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:12,110
You.

494
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:20,760
It looks like she heard
about you.

495
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:49,720
So this is where you were.

496
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:06,400
Isn't it nice?

497
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:15,000
Did you know that it takes eight
minutes for the sun's light

498
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,100
to travel to earth?

499
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:25,750
In other words, this light
is eight minutes old.

500
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:29,530
It's a warm color.

501
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:32,290
Yeah.

502
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:39,470
The warm light that's eight
minutes old.

503
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:49,280
It's not true, right?

504
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:56,120
I'm not really dying, am I?

505
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:01,600
I'm only 17.

506
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:09,100
What? You?

507
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:13,170
I'll be dead in six months?

508
00:43:15,870 --> 00:43:19,470
<i>At that point I had lost my research
and my girlfriend.</i>

509
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:23,480
<i>I was in despair and ready
to give up.</i>

510
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:29,220
<i>Why did I think that was
an excuse, though?</i>

511
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:34,360
It's not true, right?

512
00:43:35,330 --> 00:43:38,030
<i>Sensei...</i>

513
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:41,100
I'm sorry.

514
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:48,370
<i>You could say it gave me
the hope to live.</i>

515
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:54,200
<i>It could have been anyone.
Anybody else.</i>

516
00:43:55,110 --> 00:44:01,100
<i>Someone to perfectly understand
all my pain and frustration.</i>

517
00:44:03,690 --> 00:44:05,690
It's true.

518
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,600
You're going to...

519
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:31,600
