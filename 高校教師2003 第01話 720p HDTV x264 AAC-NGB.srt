Your first time cutting class?

6
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,906
You shouldn't have made
such a scene!

7
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:06,450
Here.

8
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:08,600
Put these on.

00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:17,770

Got the camera?

You don't want a stupid one,

00:02:07,534 --> 00:02:11,310
I know these.
There's a trick to them.

Hey! Wait!

25
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:39,620
Why did you try to make
friends with me?

26
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,860
As soon as my suspension was
over you wanted to be friends.

27
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,186
You're such a prissy girl.

28
00:02:51,186 --> 00:02:53,357
You really get on my nerves.

29
00:02:53,357 --> 00:02:56,700

<i>They're off to a good start...</i>

<i>At that time I was just afraid
to be alone.</i>

<i>- I wasn't searching for love.</i>

<i>Being alone scared me

You did it! That was fast.

You were laid off?
My father was too, recently.

55
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:49,380
Probably because
of the recession.

56
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:54,560
I quit though.
Not that it really matters.

57

58
00:05:55,949 --> 00:06:01,240

65

00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,840

- Yeah.

74
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:19,890
Come on in.

75
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,900
Thanks for inviting me in.

76
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:31,270
That's cool.

77
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:34,040
It's instead of using notebooks.

78
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:36,920
What's this for?

79
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:40,200
It's from Newton's <i>Principia.</i>

80
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,600
Book I, Proposition XX,
Problem XII.

81
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:51,630
It's about ellipses, parabolas,
and hyperbolas all being related.

82
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:58,370
What's that?
It's kind of gross looking.

83
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:02,010
It's Thomas Wright's depiction,
infinite universes

84
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:03,950
with God's eye at the center.

85
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:07,750
He tried to explain the phenomenon
of the Milky Way

86
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,140
through mathematics.

87
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,450
You obviously don't understand.

88
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,400
That's not necessarily true.

89
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,400
Really?

90
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:20,300
- Well...
- Of course.

91
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:27,800
How about a shower?

92
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,600
A shower?

93
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,280
Do you want to go first
or should I?

94
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:38,210
I...

95
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:41,273
I'll go first, then.

96
00:08:41,273 --> 00:08:43,206
Go ahead.

97
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,380
- All right.
- All right.

98
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:20,900
Hello?

99
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:24,029
<i>You're not still with him,
are you?</i>

100
00:09:24,029 --> 00:09:26,590
Well...

101
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:29,730
<i>I kind of went back to his
apartment with him.</i>

102
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:31,160
His apartment?!

103
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:34,370
<i>- Apparently he just moved in.</i>
- Idiot!

104
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:37,540
<i>You shouldn't go home with guys
you don't know.</i>

105
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:41,199
At first, no-one knows
anyone.

106
00:09:41,199 --> 00:09:45,210
<i>He didn't drag you there did he?
Won't he let you go home?</i>

107
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:48,020
<i>Don't worry!
I'll be there soon.</i>

108
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,840
What's so funny?

109
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,050
You're a nice person after all.

110
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,600
Aren't you worried at all?

111
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,230
Why am I getting all worked up
over this?

112
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:02,330
Just give him the phone.
I'll let him have it.

113
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,200
He's in the shower.

114
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,947
What are you thinking?

115
00:10:09,947 --> 00:10:11,500
<i>You're gonna get raped.</i>

116
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,340
Get out of there.

117
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:16,340
<i>- Did you know about me?</i>
- What?

118
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:19,350
<i>If I hadn't approached
you at school,</i>

119
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:21,280
<i>would you have known
who I was?</i>

120
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,800
What are you talking about?

121
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:28,078
<i>Even if you had seen me around,
you didn't know my name, right?</i>

122
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:30,260
I'm not the type that
stands out.

123
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,882
<i>What's your point?</i>

124
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:36,030
<i>Hello?</i>

125
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:41,230
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

126
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:47,570
You would have forgotten me
after we graduated.

127
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,443
And what's your point?

128
00:10:50,443 --> 00:10:53,260
<i>My grades are about average.</i>

129
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:57,820
Same with sports...
My family is middle-class.

130
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:01,120
<i>I don't understand. What does
this have to do with anything?</i>

131
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,360
I'm a plain, boring girl.

132
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:09,090
You even said I get
on your nerves.

133
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,054
That was...

134
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:16,960
I don't think I'm ever going
to change.

135
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,797
- Goodnight.
<i>- Wait a second!</i>

136
00:11:20,797 --> 00:11:23,200
See you at school.

137
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:44,454
<i>Principia.</i>

138
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:54,360
It's freezing!
The shower is broken.

139
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:58,570
You'll catch a cold.

140
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:01,650
I can't afford to catch a cold.

141
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,420
Sorry!

142
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:17,230
Um... I think... well...

143
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:30,880
You might be angry after we're
come this far, but...

144
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,800
You just broke up with
your boyfriend?

145
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,020
What?

146
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:39,320
Basically, you became a bit
desperate, but you can't forget

147
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:43,450
your ex-boyfriend or something.

148
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,390
Am I wrong?

149
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:51,260
- No. You're pretty close.
- I see.

150
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:55,366
I'm really sorry.

151
00:12:55,366 --> 00:12:58,000
Not a problem.

152
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:03,380
Maybe I'm better off this way.

153
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:14,359
So you lost a loved one?
Or quit your job and then...

154
00:13:14,359 --> 00:13:17,329
- ...I got desperate?
- Yeah.

155
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:18,815
Something like that.

156
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:22,090
I guess we're in the same boat.

157
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,830
We shouldn't be throwing
ourselves at each other.

158
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,130
That's right.

159
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,510
But somehow we ended up here.

160
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:42,110
Yeah. But sometimes things
turn out that way.

161
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:48,020
In life, you have to put up
with a lot stress.

162
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:54,630
- Going home?
- Yeah.

163
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:56,800
- I'll take you.
- I'll be fine.

164
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,200
Then I'll give you money
for the taxi.

165
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,900
I have money. Don't worry.

166
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,800
Okay, then.

167
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:10,340
This is kind of strange,
isn't it?

168
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:16,480
Yeah. I wonder why.

169
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:37,940
If you don't mind,
why not spend the night?

170
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:41,040
But...

171
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,710
Just to sleep.

172
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:45,640
I won't do anything.

173
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:50,920
You can tie my hands
together.

174
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,820
Can't you just sleep beside
me tonight?

175
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,800
It's my one wish in my
whole life.

176
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:02,520
Your whole life?

177
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:07,260
I'm going to die soon.

178
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:13,463
Not really.

179
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:48,970
I'll stay.

180
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:46,200
<i>Haru no komorebi no
naka de</i>

181
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:51,400
<i>Kimi no yasashisa ni</i>

182
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,710
- Good morning!
- Is that all you have to say?

183
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:55,800
Sorry for hanging up
on you last night.

184
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,200
I got worked up about it
and I couldn't sleep.

185
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,600
Sorry to have worried you.

186
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,400
I just don't want to be held
responsible if something

187
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,800
- happens to you.
- Like what?

188
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,800
Recently there have been some
horrible crimes going on.

189
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,700
You're more serious
than I thought.

190
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,400
- That's enough!
- Sorry.

191
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,120
Whatever. So...?

192
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,150
You went home after
I called, right?

193
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:42,650
You're not normal, Hina.

194
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:44,050
Really?

195
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:46,490
What's with the smile?
You're weird.

196
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:48,930
I always wanted someone
to tell me

197
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:50,630
that I'm weird, or different.

198
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:52,090
- Really?
- Yeah.

199
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:55,170
So you left in the morning?

200
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:56,670
Yeah.

201
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:58,100
What about your parents?

202
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:01,000
I told them that I was studying
at a best friend's house.

203
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,900
I've never been caught before,
so they didn't question me.

204
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,600
- Best friend?
- Yeah.

205
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:12,990
And you casually spent
the night with some guy.

206
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:16,200
He didn't seem like
a bad guy.

207
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,100
You can't tell by looking
at a person.

208
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,100
Yes, you can.

209
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,660
Not by their looks,
but just somehow I knew.

210
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,260
You were the same way.

211
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:26,500
- Me, too?
- Yeah.

212
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,300
People were spreading
rumors about you,

213
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,530
but I thought they
were wrong.

214
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:36,000
Exactly who was spreading
rumors?

215
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:41,070
I can probably guess anyway.

216
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,780
And?

217
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,700
Since you spent the night,
it's pretty obvious.

218
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,450
But I'll ask anyway...

219
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:53,050
You slept with him, right?

220
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,900
- That's a secret.
- What?

221
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:02,130
Not that I care.

222
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,040
What are they doing?

223
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,600
There's a new math teacher.

224
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,300
Remember, Shimamura<i>-san</i>
is off on maternity leave.

225
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,300
So?

226
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:19,100
Just like before, they're putting up
a math problem

227
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,600
that even university professors
can't solve.

228
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:25,710
That's bullying.

229
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,240
A classic Hamilton-Jacobi
equation.

230
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,040
First, <i>K</i> = <i>C</i>2.

231
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:51,410
<i>S</i> = integral.

232
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,800
Is he right?

233
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:11,660
- Let us begin.
- Stand.

234
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,500
Bow.

235
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,600
Sit.

236
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,900
What is it?

237
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,200
Do you have a question?

238
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,850
What are you doing?

239
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,900
I'm Koga. I'll be taking over
Grade 11 math

240
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,510
where Shimamura<i>-sensei</i>
left off.

241
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:37,770
- What page are we on?
- Page 106.

242
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:40,100
Everyone, open your books.

243
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,900
I'm head teacher of Grade 11,
Fujimura.

244
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,300
Nice to meet you.

245
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:56,700
Have you met the principal
and the head teacher?

246
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,580
Oh, I see. Good to hear.

247
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:03,800
The teachers will finish classes soon,
so I'll introduce you to them.

248
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,900
Oh, here is Tejima Emi<i>-sensei.</i>
She teaches the classics.

249
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,700
She just started last spring.

250
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,000
With her good looks, she seems
wasted on the teaching profession.

251
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,600
Wait. That could be counted
as sexual harassment.

252
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,100
Stop teasing me, boss!

253
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,010
My name is Tejima.
Nice to meet you.

254
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:22,390
I'm Koga. Nice to be working
with you.

255
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:25,500
Here is the Japanese history teacher,
Miyada Kôji<i>-sensei.</i>

256
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,750
Nice to meet you.

257
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:30,380
I'm the math teacher, Koga.
Nice to meet you.

258
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:36,260
Are you single? You're quite young
to be working here.

259
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,300
It's quite rare for someone like you
to come along,

260
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,300
because this is a girls school.

261
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:45,070
You can smoke over there.

262
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:48,490
You smoke right?
Tejima<i>-sensei</i> doesn't like it though.

263
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,500
- Sir.
-Yes?

264
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,920
I'm still single, too!

265
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:56,130
Here is Muramatsu Tamotsu,
the gym teacher.

266
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:59,510
Your looks aren't a problem.

267
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:02,420
What's that supposed to mean?

268
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:04,700
How rude! Even you,
Tejima<i>-sensei!</i>

269
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,820
I'm sorry.

270
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:08,020
No need to apologize, but...

271
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:11,220
- I'm Koga. Nice to meet you.
- Likewise.

272
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:15,300
I'll take you on a tour
of the campus, if you'd like.

273
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:19,000
With junior colleges, transition
to universities have become easier.

274
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,970
As a result, grades at this school
haven't been getting any better.

275
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,530
At best, we're the top
of the middle range.

276
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:31,950
But the girls seem to have a lot
of success with English.

277
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:35,580
- Why do you think that is?
- Why?

278
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,320
Because I'm the English teacher.

279
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,950
The sports teams are all
quite standard.

280
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,100
The tennis team that I managed

281
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:48,460
was able to get to the Tokyo
championship, though.

282
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:51,820
What sports are you good at?

283
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:58,100
Not your thing? But we have to put
you in charge of something.

284
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:08,500
Here's the language lab.

285
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:13,550
Since I became in charge,
we've upgraded the speakers.

286
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:17,640
As a result, the students'
listening skills have improved.

287
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:22,190
I heard from the director that you're
quite talented.

288
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:25,680
Huh? Not really.

289
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,400
You were in the Ministry
of Education.

290
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,200
Was there a problem?

291
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:35,280
Nothing in particular.

292
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,270
I'll tell you something.

293
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:42,620
The director likes people
with fancy resumes.

294
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:45,700
Just because someone is bright,

295
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:48,950
it doesn't mean they'll make
a good teacher.

296
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:54,500
The other teachers
are worthless.

297
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,990
I'm the only good
teacher here.

298
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:01,100
I'll warn you right now.

299
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:05,200
If you're here to look down on me,
we're going to have a problem.

300
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:09,170
Those aren't my intentions.

301
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:13,610
Excuse me. Maybe I've been a bit
stressed out recently.

302
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,700
No need to show you
the prep room.

303
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,820
You won't be going
in there anyway.

304
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:24,000
- Goodbye!
- Goodbye!

305
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,700
The amount of bathrooms
here is very small.

306
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:34,300
But be sure not to use the ladies
room, even if its empty.

307
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:39,000
You won't just get fired,
you'll be arrested.

308
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,170
You've got to be kidding.

309
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:44,470
The new teacher is the guy
you spent the night with?

310
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,610
This isn't a joke, right?

311
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:53,550
- Do you have any questions?
- Goodbye!

312
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:55,710
Not at present.

313
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:59,460
If you have anything on your mind,
just let me know.

314
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:00,510
Thanks.

315
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:05,160
One day I woke up and I was
a senior teacher.

316
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:13,100
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

317
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,600
Goodbye.

318
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,600
It must be a different person.
He didn't even respond.

319
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:28,500
- We're both in the same boat.
- You mean he doesn't know?

320
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,560
I was wearing make-up. I told him
that I was 20 and a stylist.

321
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:34,560
But don't you think he'd
recognized you?

322
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:38,080
Even though you had sex?

323
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,700
You were with him until
morning, right?

324
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,700
You didn't make this all up,
did you?

325
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,020
I didn't!

326
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,880
He's different from this
morning.

327
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:47,370
- You...
- Yes.

328
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:49,960
You're a student of mine?

329
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,320
Yeah.

330
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:56,640
But wait, you don't know
who I am?

331
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:00,380
I'm the new math teacher.

332
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,740
Yeah...

333
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:06,080
Today we had a class.

334
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:09,770
- Grade 11?
- Right.

335
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:13,090
Sorry. Which class were
you in?

336
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:16,520
- Class B.
- Oh.

337
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,400
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THIS BUS WILL GO BY

338
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,700
JAPAN WOMEN'S MEDICAL
UNIVERSITY

339
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:59,570
Young residents these days!
You'll never learn to be surgeons!

340
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:02,390
What on Earth are you
here for?

341
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,580
How is teaching? Do you think
you can get used to it?

342
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:09,910
Who knows.

343
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,400
You're lucky that the director
is a patient of mine,

344
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,210
and I was able to get
you the job.

345
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:20,960
The director is always complaining
about some ailment.

346
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:25,130
You shouldn't be on your own.

347
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:28,240
- Don't you agree?
- I do.

348
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,940
At your old workplace, you were
surrounded by computers.

349
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:34,400
You didn't get a chance
to speak to anyone.

350
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,670
That's a bad environment
for you.

351
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:38,170
Yes.

352
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,400
How about your girlfriend?

353
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:48,700
ISHIKURA KAORI

354
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:53,990
That's her.
She never gives up.

355
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:59,250
She's obviously worried
that I suddenly quit my job.

356
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:03,190
- Did you tell her the truth?
- No.

357
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:05,230
It's for the best.

358
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:12,650
She always calls, but I never pick up.
So she keeps trying.

359
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:16,000
Why not just say you've fallen
in love with another woman?

360
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,050
Tell her she's a nuisance
and to stop calling.

361
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:26,180
She'll think you're a monster.
Does that bother you?

362
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:29,160
Sorry for talking like this.

363
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,430
Not at all.

364
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:34,670
But in the end,
you're doing her a favor.

365
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:39,640
It's better for her to be able
to forget me.

366
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:42,300
It's a standard way to end
a relationship.

367
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:48,440
And then she'll be able to find
a new boyfriend.

368
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:56,550
It sounds so harsh,
but this is real life.

369
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,710
I...

370
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:05,500
You're very brave.

371
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,390
Good boy...

372
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,140
- Come on!
- Get lost!

373
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:16,440
At least come
for a drink with us.

374
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:20,650
Guys who try to pick up chicks
like this are so lame.

375
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:24,600
If you're just hanging around like
this, you obviously want a guy.

376
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,240
I'm not joking.

377
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:32,060
- Hey, you just sighed, didn't you?
- What?

378
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:35,640
- Who the hell are you?
- Now, wait a second.

379
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:41,530
Hold up, guys. A girl can get
wrinkles just by sighing too much.

380
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:45,270
- Who do you think you are?
- Let's go.

381
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:47,470
It's their fault, right?

382
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:50,730
First lesson!

383
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:55,000
If you approach a girl three to one,
you're going to scare her.

384
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:00,410
Second lesson!

385
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:06,220
It's not a great strategy
to be too obvious.

386
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:11,860
Last but not least!

387
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:17,680
Because girls believe
in stuff like fate,

388
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,470
you have to play along.

389
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:21,140
You!

390
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:42,500
And another big sigh.

391
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:45,460
Just do what I'm doing
for a sec.

392
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:55,340
I'm your personal genie!

393
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:59,170
I like to stand out,
so I made a bit of scene.

394
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:05,720
Or did I help you out
for nothing?

395
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:08,440
No.

396
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:11,930
So why don't we go
for some karaoke?

397
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:18,460
Or would that bring me down
to the level of these guys?

398
00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:00,600
Just as I thought.

399
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:50,040
Help me...

400
00:33:54,080 --> 00:34:00,030
In Grade 11 we will cover all
of Japanese history.

401
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:02,680
We have been going
quite fast,

402
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:07,320
but from the third semester
we start the 20th century.

403
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:13,130
Let's talk about when
the Western date system

404
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:17,230
started in Japan.

405
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:24,010
It started in 1901 at Keiô University
when they had a party

406
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:27,710
to usher in the 20th century.

407
00:34:27,910 --> 00:34:32,850
The head teacher asked you to help
with patrol tonight, right?

408
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:35,800
It's cold.

409
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:40,450
Did you bring a change
of clothing?

410
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:45,520
Our duties outside of class
are pretty difficult.

411
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:49,060
Also, don't forget about managing
a sports team.

412
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:51,900
It's not a big deal though.

413
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:54,370
Just organizing competitions
and stuff.

414
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:55,800
But... I...

415
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,670
The gym teacher,
Muramatsu<i>-sensei.</i>

416
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:58,800
Huh?

417
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:02,440
He's not that great looking,
but until you came

418
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,900
he was quite popular.

419
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:07,900
He says that recently that's
all disappeared.

420
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:10,680
He was grumbling about it
in the teachers' room.

421
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:12,180
Here.

422
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:23,730
Not sure where to put
your eyes?

423
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:25,900
It's okay.

424
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:32,400
I couldn't believe it either,
but the girls wanted you.

425
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,940
What?

426
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:39,720
Didn't you notice?
You're very popular.

427
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:43,540
Look! They're all
staring at you.

428
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:37,710
- I'm Aizawa from Grade 12.
- Grade 12?

429
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:41,960
I quit the club a while back,
but swim sometimes for exercise.

430
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:48,180
I heard a handsome teacher
became the new manager.

431
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:51,000
Do you have a girlfriend?

432
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:54,300
That's not a question for a student
to ask a teacher.

433
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:59,090
You can ask me, too, questions that
teachers aren't supposed to ask.

434
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:01,600
Do you have a boyfriend?

435
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,600
Yeah. He's a university
student.

436
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:09,360
But recently we're just been
going though the motions.

437
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:13,900
For a romance to go on,

438
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:17,300
you really need some kind
of stimulation.

439
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,500
Oh?

440
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:22,100
You need obstacles to work
through together.

441
00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:30,200
Like a relationship between
a teacher and a student.

442
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:53,100
Tejima<i>-sensei</i>,
you look great!

443
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:56,380
If I passed you on the street,
I wouldn't recognize you.

444
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:57,810
Let's go!

445
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:08,360
Put your phones down!
What grade you girls in?

446
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,220
Grade 12. Class A.

447
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:18,860
Hey! Stop!

448
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:21,470
What grade?

449
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:30,810
Are they our students?

450
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:34,190
They don't look like it.

451
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:37,190
There aren't too many
of ours tonight.

452
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:39,320
Thank you.

453
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:41,760
Thank you.

454
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:53,630
This isn't working.

455
00:38:54,410 --> 00:38:56,880
Why don't we go grab
a beer somewhere?

456
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,400
We could make it Koga<i>-sensei</i>'s
welcome party.

457
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,990
Can I ask a question?

458
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:06,490
Do you know about the student
that was expelled last summer?

459
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:08,590
Her name was
Suzumoto Taeko.

460
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:11,260
The one that worked
in the sex trade, right?

461
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:14,820
It's good we dealt with her
before her parents found out.

462
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:20,470
She was one of my first students.
A really good one, too.

463
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:25,310
You don't need to feel responsible.
We can't watch them 24/7.

464
00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:28,800
That's right.
It's not your fault!

465
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,700
I talked to her.

466
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:35,350
She was lured into the business
by a host at a club called "J".

467
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:36,880
J?

468
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:40,620
There.

469
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,590
Newton...

470
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:52,290
<i>Principia.</i>

471
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:57,200
- SENDING MESSAGE
- MESSAGE SENT

472
00:39:58,470 --> 00:40:00,210
It went through!

473
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:12,400
I know that girl.

474
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,500
Did you know she committed
suicide?

475
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,700
What?

476
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:22,700
Yeah.

477
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:25,720
You don't seem to feel
guilty about it.

478
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,690
I'm sorry!

479
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:33,610
Please forgive me!

480
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:37,340
I heard that she
was very rich.

481
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:42,310
That's all I told myself.
I'm sorry.

482
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:44,810
I'm sorry!

483
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:51,580
I'm sorry! I'm sorry...

484
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:57,930
I'm sorry! It's all my fault!

485
00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:03,290
If he had gotten back up, I would
have given him a beating.

486
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:08,040
I really know how you feel about
your students now.

487
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,400
Maybe you should slow
down on the drinks.

488
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,170
Anyways, I'll be off now.

489
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:15,210
Cheers to Tejima<i>-sensei</i>'s
love!

490
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:20,790
We can't be fooled
by that idiot.

491
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:26,040
- His name was Yûji, right?
<i>- Sensei!</i>

492
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:30,810
Just because he got down on his
knees, it doesn't mean he meant it.

493
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:35,500
While he was hunched over,
his back was laughing at us.

494
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:39,800
And you?

495
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:43,200
Do you plan to continue
teaching forever?

496
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,800
I really don't know.

497
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:48,530
Can I bum a smoke?

498
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:50,580
You smoke, too?

499
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:57,490
Don't you feel like you want to teach
at a university or something?

500
00:41:57,490 --> 00:41:59,690
Not necessarily.

501
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:01,790
I see.

502
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:06,690
We've had a young teacher
like that in the past.

503
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:11,890
I was also young at one time.

504
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:17,200
He was a biology teacher,
I think.

505
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:25,550
When I look at you,
I'm reminded of him.

506
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:32,690
And that teacher went on
to a university?

507
00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:35,420
No.

508
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:41,400
Maybe one day you'll hear
about him.

509
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:49,100
A STRANGE PERSON
IS FOLLOWING ME. I'M SCARED

510
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:53,040
Please take him home.

511
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:59,190
What shall we do?
Find another place to sit down?

512
00:42:59,190 --> 00:43:01,200
I should probably
be getting back.

513
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,290
Why not just one more?

514
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:06,000
Well...

515
00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:12,470
- I'm kind of tired.
- You are?

516
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:15,370
- And there are still trains running.
- It's too bad.

517
00:43:15,370 --> 00:43:16,900
But have a safe trip home.

518
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:20,550
- Good night, then.
- Good night.

519
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:22,480
Good night.

520
00:43:25,810 --> 00:43:28,350
We should both be heading
home, too.

521
00:43:28,350 --> 00:43:32,350
- I'm still okay.
- But...

522
00:43:32,350 --> 00:43:36,160
There's no problem.
We're both adults.

523
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:43,730
I'm sorry. Maybe I've had too
much to drink.

524
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:46,170
You!

525
00:43:46,870 --> 00:43:48,690
I'm sorry.

526
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:52,490
I'm not your type anyway.

527
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:56,000
My type?

528
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:00,580
Unfortunately, there seem to be
no women that are my type.

529

531
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,300
Wait!

532
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:15,030
Was Yûji really laughing?

533
00:44:19,570 --> 00:44:23,170
<i>I was so incredibly lonely.</i>

534
00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:29,810
<i>Everything I did was in vain.
No one I talked to understood.</i>

535
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:36,410
<i>Would my exasperation slowly
turn to resignation?</i>

536
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:51,700
I'M IN THE CONVENIENCE STORE
BY YOUR PLACE.

537
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:56,800
I'M IN THE CONVENIENCE STORE

I thought you were kidding.

547
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:56,710
You lied to me before, right?
That you were 20 and a stylist.

548
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:04,190
You recognized me?

549
00:47:05,670 --> 00:47:07,090
Yeah.

550
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:10,470
Then why?

551
00:47:11,310 --> 00:47:15,010
You're a student, so I figured
I couldn't say anything.

552
00:47:15,010 --> 00:47:19,380
But you were kissing that girl
from the swimming team.

553
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:21,320
She kissed me.

554
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:25,020
If a pizza comes that you didn't
order, would you eat it?

555
00:47:25,890 --> 00:47:28,620
- I see what you mean.
- Good!

556
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:31,830
I didn't think I'd ever
see you again,

557
00:47:31,830 --> 00:47:35,150
so I let some of my weaknesses
show.

558
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:37,100
Weakness?

559
00:47:38,270 --> 00:47:42,580
That I wanted you to stay
beside me all night.

560
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:45,570
Like a child who had
a bad dream?

561
00:47:46,110 --> 00:47:49,030
Even though I'm an adult.

562
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:51,950
So you pretended you didn't
recognize me.

563
00:47:51,950 --> 00:47:53,550
Right.

564
00:47:54,280 --> 00:48:01,520
Not because I'm just some
simple, boring girl?

565
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:05,020
Huh? No.

566
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:09,060
That's good.

567
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:16,140
I...

568
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:30,890
I'll probably have a normal life,
get married, and have two kids.

569
00:48:30,890 --> 00:48:36,050
Maybe that's supposed to be
happiness, but what if it isn't?

570
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:42,060
For some reason I just started
thinking that way.

571
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:45,660
I wanted a secret all
for myself.

572
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:49,070
A secret?

573
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:52,800
Even if I'm not happy
in that new life,

574
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:56,100
I would have a secret
from my past.

575
00:48:57,750 --> 00:49:00,280
But why do you want that?

576
00:49:01,550 --> 00:49:07,650
My father was laid off, and my
whole family was left suffering.

577
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:11,420
I just don't know.

578
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:17,290
I would like to go back to being
my normal self.

579
00:49:18,130 --> 00:49:22,990
If only I had that secret
to take with me.

580
00:49:24,070 --> 00:49:29,060
But if the only person that shares
that secret with me...

581
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:33,210
...doesn't remember it,
there's no point.

582
00:49:39,890 --> 00:49:43,950
I'm happy that you
remembered.
