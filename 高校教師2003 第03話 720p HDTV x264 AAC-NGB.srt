3
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,700
<i>What about the life
expectancy?</i>

4
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,700
<i>Only five percent of patients
of this disease survive.</i>

5
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,560
<i>I'd say six months at most.</i>

6
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,560
<i>It's a warm color.</i>

7
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,660
<i>I'm not really dying, am I?</i>

8
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:34,530
<i>I'm only 17.</i>

9
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,800
<i>At that point I don't think
I understood the purpose</i>

10
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,000
<i>of my "experiment".</i>

11
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,180
<i>Why?</i>

12
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,650
<i>Because it wasn't true.</i>

13
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:56,880
<i>I was going to tell her.</i>

14
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,400
<i>To explain that it wasn't her who
was going to die - it was me.</i>

15
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,300
Stand.

16
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,700
Bow. Sit.

17
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,700
<i>This girl's fate isn't the same
as mine.</i>

18
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:13,100
<i>What lies in her future?
I don't love you anymore.</i>

19
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:18,270
<i>When I'm in love,
I wanted it to last forever.</i>

20
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:21,710
<i>I'm sorry. It's true.</i>

21
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,240
<i>You're going to...</i>

22
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:28,480
Of course I don't go
to host clubs!

23
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:33,060
Don't misunderstand.
We're not trying to punish you.

24
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,200
I understand that a girl your
age wants to experience

25
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,360
different things.

26
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,930
You're being quite lenient.

27
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:46,970
That's right. Usually what you did
would be grounds for expulsion.

28
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:48,740
Thank Fujimura<i>-sensei.</i>

29
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:51,900
You're just scared
of my parents, right?

30
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,700
They contribute so much
to the school.

31
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:59,080
Money can't buy you
respectability.

32
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:03,520
If students stop coming to our
school, there is no more school.

33
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:09,320
We can't afford these kinds
of distractions.

34
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,190
Next time, we won't be
so understanding.

35
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:15,030
Are you threatening me?

36
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,970
Why not try and follow
the rules?

37
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:30,200
Sorry about that girl
in my class.

38
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,300
Corporal punishment doesn't have
a place in schools today.

39
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,450
Of course not.

40
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:38,820
But that doesn't mean
you can't discipline them.

41
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,060
If you aren't firm,
they'll walk all over you.

42
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:47,290
I'm sorry.

43
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:55,640
- Could I have some, too?
- Sure.

44
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:59,570
"If you aren't firm,
they'll walk all over you."

45
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,350
There used to be this teacher
I hated.

46
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:10,320
He was a gym teacher.

47
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:14,490
What a moron.

48
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:17,030
But...

49
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:20,000
Now I sound just like him.

50
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,430
Strange, huh?

51
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:24,730
Still, I'm sure she won't
go back.

52
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,700
Thanks.

53
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:31,710
Somehow I don't think that host
will give up so easily.

54
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:35,510
He knows that she's rich.

55
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,610
That's why he's after her.

56
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,290
You seem to be enjoying
yourself.

57
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:49,760
After a while,
just teaching gets boring.

58
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,000
You know?

Sorry to have kept
you waiting.

65
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:39,300
I understand you overheard
the discussion

66
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,600
I had with your teacher?

67
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,230
Is it true?

68
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:45,400
What did your teacher say?

69
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,970
- That it was.
- He's right.

70
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:54,140
I can imagine how you
must feel.

71
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:56,940
There isn't any sort of cure?

72
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,140
Unfortunately not.

73
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:05,350
What about a different
hospital?

74
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:08,100
If you want a second opinion,
I can write a letter

75
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,250
of recommendation.

76
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:14,900
Sorry, I don't mean to question
you're competence. But...

77
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:18,100
For the right price a doctor
somewhere can be convinced

78
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,300
to perform some kind
of procedure.

79
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:26,540
But that might just lead
to premature death.

80
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:29,500
I know it sounds harsh.

81
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,240
Oh, really?

82
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,350
Go ahead and sit down.
Why are you so worried anyway?

83
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:47,590
He...

84
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:51,230
Your teacher...

85
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:54,830
Your...

86
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:01,840
I see.

87
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:08,140
What should I do?

88
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:13,720
What should I do at a time
like this?

89
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:17,520
What am I saying?

90
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,490
Good question.

91
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:29,040
You just have to be strong.

92
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:33,070
Strong?

93
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,500
My homeroom teacher is really
easy, so it's no big deal.

94
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:45,100
But my grade supervisor...

95
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:48,520
When he's involved,
it can get scary.

96
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,460
Which teacher?

97
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:54,690
What's his name?

98
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:57,160
It's Fujimura.

99
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:02,700
Oh, Fujimura<i>-sensei?</i>

100
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:08,770
I just wanted to see what
a host club was really like.

101
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:16,880
But, I guess I'm not supposed
to go there anymore.

102
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,280
Oh? I'm hurt.

103
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,920
That isn't anything
against you.

104
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:32,630
I wouldn't mind meeting you
like this, or going out.

105
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:39,400
So you don't really care about
me one way or the other.

106
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,910
You probably have lots
of girls.

107
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:46,940
- Why, because I'm a host?
- Yeah.

108
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:51,450
- They're just customers.
- I can't see it like that.

109
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:57,190
I'm naturally very jealous.

110
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:59,200
You don't really look it.

111
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:04,400
If my boyfriend worked as a host
I'd be really worried.

112
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,200
It wouldn't work.

113
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:10,200
Really?

114
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,740
I'm sorry.

115
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:15,840
It's okay.

116
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,800
You guys again?

117
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,700
Looks like you two
are having fun.

118
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,650
You owe us for giving
her away.

119
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:28,200
You guys want
to get beaten up again?

120
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,590
Hey! Wait a second.

121
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:36,230
- What is this?
- Don't do this in front of her.

122
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:40,230
- Scared of getting caught?
- About what?

123
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:44,940
The other night was all a joke.
We were all in on it.

124
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:48,640
- You're not serious?
- Why don't you ask him?

125
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,710
I paid you guys, right?

126
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:57,850
You didn't pay us damages
for beating us up.

127
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:01,290
Yeah. I was in the hospital
for days.

128
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,590
Stop with the jokes.

129
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:05,750
Shut up and hand over
the cash.

130
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:12,130
This is all you got?
You must be a lousy host.

131
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:14,000
You!

132
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,900
I asked the wrong guys
for help.

133
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,910
You're right.

134
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:27,280
I hope you two live happily
ever after.

135
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:33,280
So you knew all about me?

136
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:37,200
- I knew that you were rich.
- I should have guessed.

137
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,790
That's what it was
at first, but...

138
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:43,460
You prick!

139
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:49,730
Wait, Beniko!
Listen to me for a second!

140
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,800
Or not...

141
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,400
How did we do?

142
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:05,750
This is where the fun
begins.

143
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,100
WELCOME HOME

144
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:27,100
Takeout food again?

145
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,000
Yeah.

146
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:40,180
- Does it surprise you?
- Huh?

147
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:44,120
That I'm acting normal.

148
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:48,500
- Yeah.
- I didn't go to school today.

149
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:52,630
- I know.
- I got up to the school gate.

150
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:56,670
- Yeah?
- But I just decided not to go.

151
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:58,570
Really?

152
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:02,610
And then I went
to the hospital.

153
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:04,510
- Oh. Now I get it.
- Huh?

154
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:08,210
So you heard the truth
from the doctor?

155
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,400
Yeah.

156
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:16,600
- I'm sorry.
- What do you mean?

157
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,120
What do I mean?
About lying.

158
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:28,200
Part of me wished you had lied
and told me I was fine,

159
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,400
but I don't know.

160
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:37,040
Even hearing the doctor say it
somehow it just doesn't seem real.

161
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,380
- She told you?
- Yeah.

162
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:46,020
Apparently, I can't be saved.

163
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:57,230
But for some reason
it hasn't sunk in.

164
00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:03,360
I mean, I feel fine.
I have a great appetite, too.

165
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,430
Well, the...

166
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:08,900
It's like being told by a fortune teller
that I'll be in a car accident.

167
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:14,510
Somewhere inside me, I believe
that it won't happen.

168
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:23,320
- Are you eating?
- What?

169
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,320
Yeah.

170
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:34,230
But it's the truth, I guess.

171
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:38,140
- What do you think?
- About what?

172
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:42,970
I mean, everyone dies
at some point.

173
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,140
True.

174
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:49,300
I guess it's scary because you
won't know what the world

175
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,900
is like after you die.

176
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:59,100
And I guess it's sad to think
that everyone

177
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:02,230
will eventually forget you.

178
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:04,390
That's stupid.

179
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:08,800
Eventually the people
who remember you will die, too.

180
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,400
Right?

181
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,500
I guess you could put it
that way.

182
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,810
I'm not scared at all.

183
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:20,400
Maybe I'm being too bold.
I'm surprised.

184
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,850
You're like other kids
these days.

185
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:29,890
These days?

186
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:33,600
Like those juvenile delinquents
who think that

187
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,830
because their lives are empty,
then so are everyone else's.

188
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,960
I wonder.

189
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:44,870
Maybe you're right.

190
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:47,470
Personally,
I can't understand it.

191
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:50,000
How can anyone say
they don't fear death?

192
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,240
To say you're not sad
that you'll be forgotten.

193
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,710
- I don't get it.
<i>- Sensei?</i>

194
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:00,480
I thought you'd be more
frightened.

195
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,400
You weren't at school, so I figured
you were crying alone at home.

196
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,690
You were worried about me?

197
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:13,460
I was relieved to see you
so normal.

198
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:16,830
Nobody knows about
your illness yet.

199
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:22,200
I guess I'm the only one you can
express your true feelings to.

200
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:27,110
- Well...
- Well, what?

201
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:32,880
It hasn't sunk in yet?
The doctor told you, right?

202
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,590
Dying isn't frightening
or sad?

203
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:38,590
Why are you upset?

204
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:42,530
I'm not. I just don't get it.

205
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:44,800
You don't understand?

206
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:50,930
You wouldn't know what it's like
to be in my position.

207
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:59,440
You're right.

208
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,800
If you're not going to eat,
go home.

209
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,750
I have to make the test
for tomorrow.

210
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,580
Can't I stay a bit longer?

211
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:12,460
I can't make the test
in front of you.

212
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:17,060
I guess you're right.

213
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:41,290
- Hina isn't here today.
- Okay.

214
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:46,220
What's your name? I might be
able to answer your question.

215
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:49,220
Oh, here he is. Please hold.

216
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:53,160
Boss, it's the phone.
Line four.

217
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:59,400
Hello, this is Fujimura
speaking.

218
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,800
Is it a woman?

219
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,570
No. It sounded like
a young man.

220
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:08,940
Oh.

221
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:13,080
Understood. Bye, then.

222
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,990
What does he want,
calling you up like that?

223
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:25,190
Sorry to drag you along.

224
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:29,830
I should really have brought along
Tejima, the homeroom teacher,

225
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:32,000
but she gets really
emotional.

226
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,600
And I have a poker face?

227
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:42,270
You seem like a reasonable
person.

228
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:45,180
Of course, you might just
be pretending.

229
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:48,000
Everyone pretends to be
something else,

230
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,350
whether they're good at it
or not.

231
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:53,020
Welcome!

232
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:59,320
Sorry. I fell asleep.

233
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:02,430
- And what do you want?
- No time for chitchat?

234
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:04,930
- Coffee, please.
- Sure thing.

235
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,660
Is this about Kudô Beniko?

236
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:13,100
She seems to have
blown me off.

237
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,900
She won't come to my
club anymore.

238
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,870
Of course she won't.
She's a minor.

239
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:21,510
She says she's scared of you
and that she'll be expelled.

240
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:24,720
- And?
- I guess I lost this time.

241
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,200
A sensible girl wouldn't
let you fool her.

242
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,900
No. It was just bad strategy
on my part.

243
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,100
Bad strategy?

244
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:36,890
Yeah. She's a naive girl
with tons of money.

245
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:40,500
She has lots of material things,
but emotionally she's empty.

246
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:46,270
So obviously she's looking
for a knight in shining armor.

247
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:52,940
That's what I read,
but I guess I was wrong.

248
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:57,080
This is what you came to tell us?
To admit defeat?

249
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,520
Defeat?

250
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:02,390
In a way.
All of this is just a game.

251
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:05,920
There are winners
and losers.

252
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:09,730
But, it's not over yet.

253
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:15,400
I think I'll try for a comeback.

254
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:26,180
Why not change your target?
I'm sure there are many others.

255
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:30,250
- I hate to lose, you see.
- So what now?

256
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:33,720
A declaration of war against
us teachers?

257
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:39,390
If the game is to continue,
it's only fair that I get help.

258
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,300
It's like <i>Final Fantasy.</i>

259
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:48,830
Let's just go. There's no point
listening to him.

260
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:51,300
Right.

261
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,580
I hate teachers.

262
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:28,870
At first I thought she came because
she was worried about you.

263
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:35,880
Her name is Machida
Hina<i>-chan</i>, right?

264
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:42,950
But she seems to think that
it is her tumor, not yours.

265
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,690
Yeah.

266
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:47,420
Obviously she misunderstood.

267
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:51,000
After all, she was taken
to the hospital

268
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
after hitting her head.

269
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,600
Right.

270
00:20:56,530 --> 00:21:00,840
But you lied to her
when she asked you.

271
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:05,810
I was a bit agitated, and it accidentally
came out that way.

272
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:11,650
I figured that she'd discover
the truth after talking to you.

273
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:13,720
Yes.

274
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:17,990
So why didn't you tell her?

275
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:21,790
Why did you keep
my lie going?

276
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:24,500
I guess it's against my duty
as a doctor.

277
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:29,800
I'm your doctor. Not her's.

278
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:36,740
If my patient wants it that way,
I won't say anything.

279
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:43,610
When she talks with her parents,
she's sure to find out.

280
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:48,290
<i>She was worried about
money.</i>

281
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:55,100
<i>If there was no chance of recovery,
she didn't want her parents to know.</i>

282
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:59,400
That's what she said.

283
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:04,770
And I told her there was nothing
to be done.

284
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:09,570
<i>Hearing that,
she just accepted it.</i>

285
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:16,410
What a strong girl.
Very different from you.

286
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:19,920
<i>Maybe it's the difference between
men and women.</i>

287
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:23,790
It's just an act. I was the same
at first, too.

288
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:28,690
You try to convince yourself
that it's okay.

289
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:32,400
"It's no big deal. Everyone dies
at some point."

290
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,700
You just put up a strong
face to the world,

291
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,970
as though everything
was fine.

292
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,900
It's just an act.

293
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:52,280
- For her, too.
<i>- Bye-bye, onêchan!</i>

294
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:55,000
Bye-bye!

295
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,200
I'M BACK

296
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:40,300
Found you!

297
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,530
How long have you
been here?

298
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:45,540
I've been playing
with the kindergarten kids.

299
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:49,040
Cutting school to play again?

300
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:53,740
I'm a good student, so my
attendance is way above average.

301
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,740
Here.

302
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,760
My dad...

303
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,700
My dad has started
drinking a lot.

304
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:27,780
He must be worn out
from job hunting everyday.

305
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:31,920
Really?

306
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:38,600
My mom started working,
and now all they do is fight.

307
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:43,260
So...

308
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:48,600
You just don't want
to go home?

309
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,550
I'm sorry.

310
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:06,980
Why are you apologizing?

311
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:10,290
I couldn't sympathize
with you.

312
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:15,590
I guess I'm stressed
with this job.

313
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:20,360
You're not angry anymore?

314
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:25,330
But why were you shrugging
it off so easily yesterday?

315
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:29,140
You're not responsible
for me anyway.

316
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:35,250
That's what it's about?

317
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:40,200
If I just cried about it, you'd probably
get fed up with me.

318
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,290
Just like how my mom gets fed
up with my dad's complaints.

319
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:56,000
If you turn me away
then I'll have no one.

320
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:01,300
So you're happy to receive
sympathy?

321
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:10,380
I don't know. I'm not sure anyone
has really understood me.

322
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:12,880
I'm sorry.

323
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,890
Don't worry.

324
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,700
You poor thing.

325
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,000
You poor thing.

326
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,200
You poor thing.

327
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,800
You poor thing.

328
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,800
There's no reason
for you to worry.

329
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:22,080
Get it? You're...

330
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,930
You're...

331
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,570
What are you two doing
in there?

332
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:39,100
Ouch!

333
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,100
GOOD MORNING

334
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:15,140
- Good morning.
- What?

335
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:17,700
What do you mean?

336
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:20,100
You're like a different person
from last night.

337
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:23,550
I'm not a morning person.

338
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:25,750
Yesterday you said,
"You poor thing."

339
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:28,020
- I did?
- Four times.

340
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:32,020
- I guess.
- Only you know about this.

341
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:34,190
So what?

342
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:37,590
If you want more sympathy,
why not tell everybody?

343
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:41,430
It's not necessarily about
sympathy.

344
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:44,230
Then what do you want
from me?

345
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,800
Only you know about this.

346
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:51,100
- So what?
- Huh?

347
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,450
I don't like you when you
get this way.

348
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:59,850
Well, I don't like you
when you act like this either.

349
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:07,220
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

350
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,600
Good morning.

351
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:15,370
- Good morning.
- "Good morning."

352
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:19,300
- There's a swimming meet today.
- Really?

353
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:22,440
We need you to time
the races.

354
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,840
I'm a bit busy.

355
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:29,300
- I'll help you out.
- Thanks.

356
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:33,780
- "Thanks."
- You really have to come.

357
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:36,890
- Okay, then.
- Later.

358
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,600
<i>Sensei.</i>

359
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,970
Good morning.

360
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,510
Is that guy someone's
boyfriend?

361
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,300
<i>I wonder why he's here.</i>

362
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:10,100
<i>There's no question that he's
the same guy from the club.</i>

363
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:13,090
- None.
- Tejima<i>-sensei</i>, don't worry.

364
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:15,800
I'll go bust him up.

365
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:21,230
He's not actually inside
the school grounds.

366
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:23,800
He just has his bike stopped
on a public road.

367
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:28,470
- But!
- Just as the boss says.

368
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:34,540
- Should we warn Kudô?
- Yeah.

369
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:39,480
- Were you two in a fight?
- I told him it was over.

370
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:44,150
- Why?
- He made everything up.

371
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:46,390
Made what up?

372
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:49,990
Apparently he knew that my
family was rich.

373
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,360
I wonder who he heard
it from?

374
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:58,440
He must have something
to tell you.

375
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:04,010
I bet he just wants to make up
more excuses.

376
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:07,210
Maybe he's after a different
girl now.

377
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:12,320
Like the daughter of the restaurant
owner in class C.

378
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:15,590
Maybe you're right.
That's not so bad.

379
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:21,120
Look! He's drinking milk
and eating bread as well.

380
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,960
More importantly,
are you okay now?

381
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,390
About what?

382
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:29,970
You had a cold, right?
Don't give it to me.

383
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:38,840
<i>Kudô Beniko-san, please report
to the teachers' room immediately.</i>

384
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:41,450
They're calling you!

385
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:45,150
It's all his fault.

386
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:53,220
Beni...

387
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,600
Nothing.

388
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,500
If you want the yogurt,
go ahead.

389
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:03,370
Okay, thanks.

390
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:33,460
I did knock.

391
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:37,530
Tejima<i>-sensei</i> told me
to come here.

392
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:42,100
She's your homeroom teacher
but I'm in charge of your well being.

393
00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:51,480
I have no interest in him.

394
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,720
All right, then.

395
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:57,420
Just don't hang out with
him anymore.

396
00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:00,820
I should just ignore him,
right?

397
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:02,600
Yeah.

398
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:11,900
You can go now.

399
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:25,480
Um... <i>Sensei.</i>

400
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:30,950
- Yeah?
- Why are you single?

401
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:34,560
In the past did you have a big
falling out with someone?

402
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:39,200
- And if I did?
- Oh, nothing.

403
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:46,200
<i>Stop it! Stop it!</i>

404
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:59,120
Please go now.

405
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,950
Okay.

406
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:10,830
Did I ask something bad?

407
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:33,120
Two minutes 18 seconds.
Two minutes 21 seconds.

408
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:36,350
Two minutes 17 seconds.

409
00:34:37,390 --> 00:34:41,190
Does that girl want
to join the team?

410
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:44,260
No idea.

411
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:50,930
Ready!

412
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:57,940
- What?
- Huh?

413
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:00,710
Is there something
you want?

414
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:02,710
I just came to talk
to Koga<i>-sensei.</i>

415
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:06,500
I'm sorry, but he's helping
the team right now.

416
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,100
Oh.

417
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,970
He's been waiting all day.

418
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:54,100
So he wasn't waiting
for me.

419
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,970
Whatever.

420
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:26,400
Kids these days just don't have
any common sense.

421
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,570
It looks like that guy
finally left.

422
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:31,170
I wonder what it was.

423
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:33,440
- Tejima<i>-sensei.</i>
- Yes?

424
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,940
How would you like
to go out for a drink?

425
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:40,640
- For real?
- Are you paying?

426
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,350
Sorry, but just the two of us.

427
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:47,450
I'll be waiting outside.

428
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:19,750
It's not that I don't understand
the way you feel.

429
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:24,120
You're looking to depend
on somebody.

430
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:28,260
And I guess that person
is me in this case.

431
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:34,200
Am I depressing?
I'll try to act cheerful.

432
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:37,940
No matter how hard you try,
it's easy to see through.

433
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:41,040
You're still so hard on me.

434
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,780
But I guess you're a bit better
than this morning.

435
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:48,980
I just feel so useless.
I can't do anything for you.

436
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:53,720
I'm not asking for anything.

437
00:37:57,620 --> 00:38:00,500
When I was sitting
in the tube at the park,

438
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,900
you started to say
something?

439
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:08,570
You said, "Get it? You are..."

440
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:11,530
I guess I did.

441
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:16,210
How does the sentence end?

442
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,380
What were you going to say?

443
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:28,720
<i>Sensei?</i>

444
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,160
I broke up with my
boyfriend.

445
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:33,490
Really?

446
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:38,000
It was so boring there was no
point in continuing.

447
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,800
But you said it would be hard
to break up with him

448
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,100
without a real reason.

449
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:45,100
I told him that I was in love
with someone else.

450
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:47,300
Excuse me,
but I was still talking...

451
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,300
You didn't say...

452
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:51,110
...that he's my new math
teacher.

453
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:52,510
Come on, now.

454
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:55,680
I said that we would get married
after I graduated.

455
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,610
We weren't finished
talking yet!

456
00:38:57,610 --> 00:38:59,320
He cried.

457
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:03,020
That just put me off
even more.

458
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:08,000
- Poor guy.
- No! Poor me.

459
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,800
Dating a man like him.
I don't know what I was thinking.

460
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,600
I don't feel sorry
for you at all.

461
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:54,800
We can't do this! Stop it!

462
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:10,820
I'll see you tomorrow
at school.

463
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:50,530
Stop it! There's no point
in thinking about this.

464
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:53,200
Óscar Domínguez's
<i>La pétrification du temps.</i>

465
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,670
Think in three dimensions.

466
00:40:55,670 --> 00:41:01,270
Think of two different seconds
of a single lion's life.

467
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:07,800
Basically between those seconds
you can break the lion's life

468
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,750
into infinitely smaller pieces.

469
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:15,720
Spherical geometry is analogous
to triangles larger than 180 degrees.

470
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:20,290
And in the case of it being smaller
than 180 degrees, the radius...

471
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:24,230
Poor me.

472
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:32,670
Poor me.

473
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,840
Poor me.

474
00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:45,450
Poor me.

475
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,600
- Hello?
<i>- Sensei?</i>

476
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:02,370
Oh, it's you.

477
00:42:02,370 --> 00:42:04,900
<i>I'm sorry about today.</i>

478
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:08,510
You've apologized
so many times.

479
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:11,840
<i>I was hoping you didn't
catch a cold.</i>

480
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:16,280
I'm fine. You're worried about
something like that?

481
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:19,480
<i>It's strange.</i>

482
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:25,360
<i>I never thought I'd snap
like that.</i>

483
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:30,890
<i>Usually, I keep my anger
bottled up.</i>

484
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:34,260
Yeah.

485
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:37,130
<i>Maybe it's because
of my illness.</i>

486
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:42,270
<i>I don't like it. I'm becoming
a bad person.</i>

487
00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:46,810
<i>Or maybe I was always
like this.</i>

488
00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:50,150
What time do you think it is?

489
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:52,580
<i>Oh, I'm sorry.</i>

490
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:55,550
<i>But...</i>

491
00:43:01,530 --> 00:43:04,660
I can't sleep.

492
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:20,780
<i>At that point I began to understand
the implications of what I was doing.</i>

493
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:24,350
<i>I remember trembling
all over.</i>

494
00:43:24,350 --> 00:43:27,280
<i>Hey.</i>

495
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:36,060
Tell me what you wanted to say,
that time at the park.

496
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:40,100
All right, sure.

497
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:44,430
<i>I wonder why.</i>

498
00:43:44,430 --> 00:43:46,230
Huh?

499
00:43:48,010 --> 00:43:54,140
At night you become
really gentle.

500
00:43:55,250 --> 00:43:59,050
I like the voice
of the gentle you.

501
00:43:59,050 --> 00:44:02,850
It makes me feel better.

502
00:44:02,850 --> 00:44:05,460
<i>It was like looking
at a mirror.</i>

503
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:13,200
<i>We were feeling all
the same things.</i>

504
00:44:15,730 --> 00:44:22,340
That time, I was going
to say this:

505
00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:25,780
Yeah?

506
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:29,800
"Get it? You're..."

507
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:37,400
"You're not alone."

508
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:48,300
I'll always be there for you.
