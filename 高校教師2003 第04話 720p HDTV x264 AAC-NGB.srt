00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,700
Good morning.

3
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,500
<i>You poor thing.</i>

4
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,400
<i>You poor thing.</i>

5
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:29,690
It's done!

6
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:33,630
Great.

7
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,400
<i>Get it?</i>

8
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,500
<i>You're...</i>

9
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,400
<i>You're not alone.</i>

10
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:49,230
<i>I'll always be there for you.</i>

11
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:51,610
Red's my lucky color!

12
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:53,110
What's your sign?

13
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:55,250
Pisces.

14
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:58,290
Uh-oh. You'll have bad
luck today.

15
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:00,960
You're probably right.

16
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,260
Tired?

17
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:06,300
Yeah. I was on the phone with
a certain someone all night.

18
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,330
A certain someone?

19
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:11,800
When we finished it was an hour
too early to leave for school.

20
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:15,040
Why not sleep during class?
That's what I do.

21
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:20,440
A teacher sleeping in class?
Oh, maybe I should give a test.

22
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:24,350
That would be horrible!

23
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:26,910
I'm just joking.

24
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:31,190
Here.

25
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:35,260
- That's good.
- Yeah.

26
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:38,860
- Not about the test.
- What?

27
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:41,200
You're always so nice
in the evening,

28
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,700
but in the morning you're different.

29
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:48,570
You were great on the phone,

30
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:51,770
but I wondered what you'd be
like this morning.

31
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:55,200
- You came to test your theory?
- Yeah.

32
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:59,350
I'm gonna have some.

33
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:09,000
The TV horoscope said that I should
go on a date this weekend.

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,930
To an amusement park
or something.

35
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:13,430
It's not good to stay inside.
You should go for it.

36
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:16,680
- There's no one to go with.
- Just find someone to take.

37
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,950
It's a girls school.

38
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:21,800
I'm going to die soon, right?

39
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:29,680
- Want to go?
- Huh?

40
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,710
Do you want to go with me?

41
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:34,500
Can you go out with your teacher?

42
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,950
- I guess not.
- No! Let's go!

43
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:43,160
<i>My guilt was becoming heavier
and heavier.</i>

44
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:48,100
<i>I could refuse Hina nothing.</i>

45
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:54,470
What is it?

46
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:58,140
Our first date!

47
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,910
It's not a date! It's more like
babysitting.

48
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:05,380
Date! Date! Date!

49
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:09,800
- No it's not!
- Date!

50
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:16,590
<i>As long as it was
a reasonable wish.</i>

VOL.4: "KANASHII DÊTO"

56
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,190
What is he trying to accomplish?

57
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:49,270
He's working up the students.

58
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:53,110
It's hard to get them
to concentrate.

59
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,050
What do you think?

60
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,200
Fujimura<i>-sensei.</i>

61
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,600
We have no choice but to call
the police.

62
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,530
An amusement park?

63
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:12,660
Yeah.

64
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:18,200
Is that such a good idea with
a teacher? Before long...

65
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:22,540
Then again, you already had sex with
him before he was a teacher.

66
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,110
No, I didn't.

67
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:26,040
But you were with him
until morning.

68
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,800
- Nothing happened though.
- Whatever.

69
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,980
It's amazing though, isn't it?

70
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,420
That teacher is very popular.

71
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:40,320
- Really?
- Like you didn't know.

72
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,930
I can't believe you got him.

73
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:46,100
Like I said, I didn't "get him".

74
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:49,570
I guess you're kinda cute.
If you look real close.

75
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:52,590
No, I'm not. I'm plain.

76
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:57,140
You're the one who has your boyfriend
waiting outside the gates everyday.

77
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,900
I didn't tell him to.

78
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,600
He's really cool.

79
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,410
He's just after money.

80
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,990
Well, the teacher's just
pitying me.

81
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:13,320
How?

82
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,390
- Do you really want to know?
- Whatever.

83
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:20,130
- Then I won't say.
- I won't ask.

84
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:59,970
Feel free to use the textbook
while solving this problem.

85
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,900
Hina!

86
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,180
No way!

87
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,690
- Poor guy!
- Wait!

88
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:17,600
Hey!

89
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:30,270
Everybody, go back
to your seats.

90
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,270
This isn't a joke! Get off me!

91
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,630
Come on! Let go!

92
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:42,040
Let go!

93
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:49,000
- You're hurting me!
- Then get in the car!

94
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,040
How many times is she gonna
come in here?

95
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,860
She really bugs me.
What's she looking at?

96
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:20,250
Why the hell was she here before?

97
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:23,090
I don't get it. She's always
in the way.

98
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:27,300
What's she here for?
She's a nuisance.

99
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,900
You still haven't told her?

100
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:36,400
- No.
- Why not?

101
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,110
I was scared at night.

102
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:42,810
Because...?

103
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:44,970
The darkness takes hold of me.

104
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:49,050
The more I try to resist,
the more I get sucked in.

105
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:51,250
Even the sound of the clock
gets distant,

106
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:54,950
and I feel like I'm not in control
anymore.

107
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:59,210
It feels like I'm wasting away.

108
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:05,030
Sometimes I have to keep fighting
the fear and loneliness until morning.

109
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:07,230
You've said this many times.

110
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:11,570
Hina called me up, telling me
she couldn't sleep.

111
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:14,870
- So what?
- It made me think.

112
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:18,310
Maybe she was going through
the same thing.

113
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:20,010
You're using her like a mirror.

114
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:22,880
Right. Just like a mirror.

115
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:28,150
And I tried to make her feel better
by telling her she's not alone.

116
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:31,250
As I said that I...

117
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,760
You felt better yourself.

118
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,600
Right.

119
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:39,800
Isn't that a bit selfish?

120
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:44,470
I'm not trying to criticize you.

121
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:49,340
It's almost predictable for someone
with an illness like yours.

122
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,000
Of course I feel guilty.

123
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,840
I'm not going to say
anything bad.

124
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,700
Just tell her the truth right away.

125
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:59,800
It's not just for her.
It's for you, too.

126
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,500
I understand what you're saying.

127
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,620
It looks like she's going through
everything that you are.

128
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,370
But of course she isn't.

129
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:08,000
Just give me some more time.

130
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,830
She's not dying.

131
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,560
Surprise!

132
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:19,000
Of course she'll get angry,

133
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,900
but she'll start smiling
again quickly.

134
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,740
You aren't going to have
a happy ending.

135
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:29,300
After this it'll be even harder.

136
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,950
Who cares about the other thing!

137
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:38,820
Anyway, you have no idea what
I'm going through!

138
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,700
Koga.

139
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:45,400
Excuse me.

140
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:50,730
If you can't bring yourself
to tell her, I will.

141
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:51,800
That's not...

142
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,270
I could just say anything.

143
00:09:56,370 --> 00:10:00,400
Like it's really a friend of yours
that's sick.

144
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,200
Shall I tell her?

145
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:10,200
Is it okay?

146
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:13,070
Fine.

147
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:15,220
I'll get you some medicine.

148
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:18,090
I'm okay.

149
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:22,200
I'll be going now.

150
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:51,560
Why don't you wait outside
of her house?

151
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:56,090
That sounds like something
a stalker would do.

152
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:59,500
- It's hard to draw the line.
- Gotcha.

153
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,660
Thanks to you, the cops gave
me a good beating.

154
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,640
Is this all part of your strategy?

155
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,800
Maybe so.

156
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,180
Did you...

157
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:14,200
Did you have a bad upbringing?

158
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,300
Abusive childhood?

159
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:25,700
Perhaps you're bitter towards
your mother,

160
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:28,330
and now you take it out
on women?

161
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:37,110
I'm sorry, but those excuses
are obsolete.

162
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:40,410
It's not like that anymore.

163
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:42,200
Why then?

164
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:46,720
I guess I have no reason.

165
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,990
Does that annoy you?

166
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:52,190
Come on, keep trying
to stop me.

167
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:55,490
I told you I enjoyed your
determination.

168
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:03,100
I'll leave you with a hint.

169
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:06,450
Teachers can't beat me
and neither can policemen.

170
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:12,440
You're all bound by the law.

171
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:29,480
Hamilton wanted to throw the old way
of doing things out the window.

172
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:33,200
Using a base of four,

173
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:39,700
he could calculate
that <i>z</i> = <i>a</i> + <i>ib.</i>

174
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,400
Hello?

175
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,850
<i>Sorry for calling so late.</i>

176
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:52,680
Can't sleep again?

177
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:58,390
Yeah. Maybe because I slept
in class today.

178
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:01,120
You were sound asleep.

179
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:08,600
About the weekend, it looks
like it's gonna rain.

180
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,000
<i>Really?</i>

181
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,110
If it rains, should we catch
a movie or something?

182
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:22,380
I'm looking at the movie times
for Shibuya and...

183
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:27,350
Hello? Are you there?

184
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:30,290
<i>We should just call it off.</i>

185
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:34,690
- Huh?
- If it rains, we should just cancel.

186
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:38,600
<i>That's not fair. Why?</i>

187
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,200
After all, I'm a teacher
and you're a student.

188
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,830
We shouldn't be seen together.

189
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:45,800
We could disguise ourselves
with sunglasses and stuff!

190
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,540
Sorry.

191
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:53,080
Hey, wait. It's dark right now.

192
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:57,410
Usually you're nice at night.

193
00:13:57,410 --> 00:13:59,980
Hey!

194
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,990
What?

195
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:19,200
<i>Sorry! There's construction in front
of my house, so the signal is bad.</i>

196
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:25,740
You didn't hang-up
by any chance?

197
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,350
Well...

198
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:32,180
How childish!

199
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:35,150
No. The phone cut out.

200
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:37,400
Really?

201
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,560
Really.

202
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,860
<i>- Really really?</i>
- Really really.

203
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,600
You're making these things?

204
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,920
How many are you going to do?

205
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:58,210
Tons! Until the rain stops.
You make some, too.

206
00:14:58,210 --> 00:14:59,440
Why should I?

207
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,850
If it's raining your boyfriend
won't be outside.

208
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:06,580
Who cares. I'm relieved
he's not out there.

209
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:09,790
Then why do you keep looking
out the window?

210
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:12,520
I'm not looking.

211
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,600
What do you girls want?

212
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,200
What are you doing?

213
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,870
Reading over my teaching
material.

214
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:28,300
- Here?
- Yeah.

215
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:31,410
You don't like other people,
do you?

216
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:36,750
- Depends on the person.
- How about rain?

217
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,400
Rain?

218
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,600
Good question.

219
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:46,060
- It depends on the kind of rain.
- It depends on the kind of rain.

220
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:48,930
- What are you doing tomorrow?
- Tomorrow?

221
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:51,530
How about going on a date
with me?

222
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:55,430
Oh. So you've broken up with your
boyfriend and have free time.

223
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:59,870
Right. It's horrible being alone
on the weekend.

224
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:01,500
I think I'll pass.

225
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,060
Because you're a teacher
and I'm a student?

226
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,610
- I already have plans.
- No way, you're just...

227
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:10,410
I have plans with another student.

228
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:13,820
It depends on the weather, but we're
going to an amusement park.

229
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:17,390
- An amusement park?
- Yep.

230
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:22,500
- It's that girl, right?
- Which girl?

231
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:28,060
That grade eleven girl always hanging
around you. Even in here.

232
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:30,100
Yes, her.

233
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:35,400
That girl? Do you feel sorry for her
or something?

234
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,860
Maybe she feels sorry for me.

235
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,000
Don't come to the pool if you're
not on our team.

236
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,300
- What's this? How childish.
- Hey, that's the first one I made!

237
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:56,080
- Stop it already!
- Who are you to say that?

238
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:00,200
I heard from a friend you were
bullied in junior high.

239
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:04,300
- Stop it! I like that one.
- Are you an idiot?

240
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:08,070
Stop coming! You're bugging
the teacher.

241
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:11,900
- I'm bugging him?
- He says you're driving him insane.

242
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,980
- He said that?
- What?

243
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:19,400
- He said that?
- Of course he did.

244
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:21,750
No way.

245
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,820
<i>If it rains, we should just cancel.</i>

246
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,040
What are you doing? Class started
a long time ago.

247
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:32,560
Don't ever come back! Idiot!

248
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,800
Are you okay, Hina?

249
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,340
Hina!

250
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:44,600
What do you think you're doing?

251
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:50,200
No!

252
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:10,600
Fujimura<i>-sensei?</i>

253
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:15,060
I'm sorry.

254
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,250
About what?

255
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:21,170
I'm just not used to that
kind of thing.

256
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,400
- What?
- I should be sorry.

257
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,000
I didn't mean to do that.

258
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,510
What?

259
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:31,310
Are you free tonight? I...

260
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:36,490
I made a mistake. I want you
to forgive me.

261
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:47,030
Hey. I'm free tonight...

262
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:55,300
- It's just an act.
- Even with the police?

263
00:20:55,300 --> 00:21:00,500
Yes. He's just trying
to win you over.

264
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:05,710
But look at the rain. He'll die.

265
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:08,100
Don't think like that.

266
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:12,200
Could you do it?

267
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:18,000
Would you go that far for me?

268
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,500
Of course not. Not even my
parents would.

269
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,500
Wait.

270
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:29,600
I can't just ignore something like this.
It's not in my nature.

271
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,500
He's just doing it to get to you.

272
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:35,200
I want someone to care
for me like that.

273
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:41,610
I want him to see the true me.

274
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,150
- You'll be expelled.
- I know.

275
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:53,020
It won't lead to a good life.

276
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:56,590
What is a good life anyway?

277
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:59,960
Do you feel like you have
a good life?

278
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,740
He's heartless. It's all
a game to him.

279
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:12,560
- I'll change him.
- You can't.

280
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,200
How do you know?

281
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,300
Wait!

282
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,860
Stop her! Stop her!

283
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:36,930
<i>Sensei.</i>

284
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:57,040
You you think you can
sleep now?

285
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,800
Yeah.

286
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,300
I've thought about it

287
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:09,090
and I'm not going to tell
the truth to that girl.

288
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:14,860
Maybe I was a bit jealous of her.

289
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:17,060
Jealous?

290
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:21,930
In psychiatric terms,
"countertransference".

291
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:25,600
While looking after you,
my patient,

292
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:29,970
I began to feel attracted to you.

293
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:34,580
Attracted to me? No way.

294
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,780
Those kind of things happen.

295
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:42,080
Although, it's not real love.

296
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:49,700
So I was trying to get her out
of the picture quickly.

297
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:58,940
But it's not like I can come over
here every night.

298
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:01,740
<i>Sensei.</i>

299
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:07,240
If you need her, I won't
tell her the truth.

300
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:12,450
I'll try to keep my perspective.

301
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:15,200
I'll tell her the truth.

302
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:18,550
Sure, she has helped me.

303
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:23,790
But on the other hand, she just
makes me feel worse.

304
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:28,530
It's like you said. She can't
take my place.

305
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:31,530
She's not going to die.

306
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:38,840
I'll tell her. After that she'll probably go
back to being just another student.

307
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:44,710
So make me a promise.
Don't abandon me!

308
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:48,990
You're the only person who
really understands me!

309
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,750
Don't be so nice to me.

310
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,790
<i>Sensei!</i>

311
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:56,300
Get some rest.

312
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:05,870
If you don't sleep then
I can't go home.

313
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:13,580
I'd be too worried.

314
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:17,200
Thanks.

315
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,270
If you want coffee, I'll make it.

316
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:11,000
I know how.

317
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:16,770
Are you French or something?

318
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:19,200
Sleeping in the nude like that.

319
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,980
Oh...

320
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:25,680
It's good for your health.

321
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:30,050
Then you should lock the door.

322
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:35,690
I must have forgot.

323
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,730
What?

324
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:48,650
My hair. I cut it.

325
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:53,740
- Go get in the shower.
- Why?

326
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,980
Why do you think? Look!

327
00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:00,720
- Look!
- What?

328
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:05,640
See?

329
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:10,700
With a sixty percent
chance of rain!

330
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,500
It worked!

331
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:22,600
Let's take a picture!

332
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:27,600
Come on! Just one!

333
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,580
Cheese!

334
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,130
This is freaky!

335
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,540
Cheese!

336
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:15,390
- You take the next one.
- Okay, here goes!

337
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:18,660
- Go!
- Cheese!

338
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:11,700
<i>Sensei!</i>

339
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:18,210
- You?
- What a surprise!

340
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,040
It sure is.

341
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:28,990
Which one should I get.

342
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:37,700
- This one please.
- Three hundred yen please.

343
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,500
This is Kazama Kiyotaka<i>-kun.</i>
He's a 3rd year university student.

344
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,400
Nice to meet you.

345
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,300
This is my math teacher,
Koga<i>-sensei.</i>

346
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,710
- Your teacher?
- Yeah.

347
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:50,310
What are you laughing at?

348
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:55,700
Hi there!

349
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,820
We just happened to run
into each other.

350
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:00,920
Is that what you're saying now?

351
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:04,760
You never know who's watching
in a place like this.

352
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:11,570
Koga<i>-sensei</i> decided to make
it a group thing.

353
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:15,270
- No, I didn't.
- He didn't know what to do.

354
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:17,190
Really?

355
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,780
Who knows.

356
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:25,680
If you don't spell it out for her,
she'll get confused.

357
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:30,200
Or is she a love interest
of yours?

358
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,910
- Of course not.
- See.

359
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:38,860
It's cute to give him notes
at school and stuff,

360
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:42,200
but don't try barging into his
private life.

361
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:47,300
I don't...

362
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:50,000
You don't what?

363
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,480
I don't have any feelings
for him!

364
00:33:57,050 --> 00:34:00,200
I don't like him at all!

365
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:05,690
How childish to run off like that.

366
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:08,730
Doesn't that tire you?

367
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:12,300
- Maybe.
- Let's go!

368
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:16,030
- This way!
- Hey, stop!

369
00:34:21,970 --> 00:34:25,470
Welcome, this way please.

370
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,980
Here you are.

371
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:36,880
- What are you thinking?
- Why?

372
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:41,500
- And what about him?
- What?

373
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:45,830
Leaving your boyfriend out
there like that.

374
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:47,900
He's not exactly my boyfriend.

375
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:52,400
I have lots of male friends
like that.

376
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,500
- I feel sorry for him.
- It's more fun that way.

377
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:02,200
He'll try even harder after
he sees this.

378
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,910
I get it.

379
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:06,700
- It's funny, right?
- Funny?

380
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:13,020
The game is more fun when there
is lots of trouble along the way.

381
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:15,960
- Game?
- Yeah. A game.

382
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:19,000
It's like <i>Final Fantasy.</i>

383
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,630
You sound like someone else
I know.

384
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:25,840
- Who's that?
- No one.

385
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:28,710
If you don't have fun,
it's your loss.

386
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:33,780
Everyone dies at some point.

387
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:38,550
If you don't have fun everyday
you'll regret it.

388
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:41,150
That's called hedonism.

389
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:46,260
It's stupid to spend all your
time worrying, isn't it?

390
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:49,300
- You're right.
- I knew it.

391
00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:55,670
I never thought you were the type
who bothered with morals.

392
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:59,070
You seem more like someone
who's looking for a good time.

393
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:00,770
Am I wrong?

394
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:06,280
Or do you actually believe
in the afterlife?

395
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:09,900
No. I don't.

396
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,250
I don't believe.

397
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:19,990
So let's have fun together.

398
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:24,130
- Together?
- I'll take you along.

399
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:28,400
- Where?
- To a world with no worries.

400
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:37,340
<i>- Sensei?</i>
- I'm okay.

401
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:40,490
The ride is just making
me feel sick.

402
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:53,300
<i>Sensei?</i>

403
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:24,400
<i>Thank you for coming
to the park today.</i>

404
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:30,760
<i>We will soon be closing.</i>

405
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:47,100
<i>Thank you for coming today.</i>

406
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:07,700
She wouldn't...

407
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:17,810
<i>I'm going to die soon, right?</i>

408
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,800
<i>She's not dying.</i>

409
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,200
What are you doing?

410
00:38:54,180 --> 00:39:00,020
It's dangerous. Please come down.
Someone help!

411
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,920
Stop it!

412
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,260
You can't do it.

413
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:11,760
I understand what you're feeling,
but you can't!

414
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,900
Think of the people you'll
leave behind.

415
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:19,200
Maybe it's impossible
to understand.

416
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:24,510
But suicide just isn't the answer.

417
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,710
People don't decide when
they are born.

418
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:34,580
Death should work the same.

419
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:37,000
That's the way life is.

420
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,200
You should live every day
to the fullest.

421
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:48,800
I understand that it's scary.

422
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:53,240
I understand the fear that you deal
with every night.

423
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:57,370
Didn't I say I was here for you?

424
00:39:57,370 --> 00:40:02,450
That I'd always be by your side?

425
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:07,900
I'm sorry. Those weren't just words.
I promised you.

426
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:12,700
I'll be thinking about you morning,
day, and night.

427
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:17,860
I won't take my eyes off you.

428
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:19,860
Really?

429
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:23,270
Really. So...

430
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,240
Darn! I almost had it, too!

431
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:43,850
I bet it hurts.

432
00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:46,520
What did you come back for?

433
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:50,200
I already won the game.

434
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,230
She's out of school, right?

435
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:56,470
It's over. Now get lost!

436
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:04,510
She ordered the most expensive
kind of champagne.

437
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:07,440
I acted like this...

438
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:12,200
"I've never been the most
successful host."

439
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:22,300
She's fell for it, and with all
the money she spends I'll be on top!

440
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:25,100
And then she asked me if
I would be satisfied

441
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:28,100
and willing to take
a respectable job.

442
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:32,400
- How heroic of her.
<i>- He's just doing it to get to you.</i>

443
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:36,210
<i>I want someone to care
for me like that.</i>

444
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:43,700
<i>I want him to see the true me.</i>

445
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,820
Bye now!

446
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:49,790
My girl is waiting.

447
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:54,120
<i>It won't lead to a good life.</i>

448
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:58,000
<i>What is a good life anyway?</i>

449
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,300
<i>Do you feel like you have
a good life?</i>

450
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:05,400
I choose "continue".

451
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:11,800
The game's not over yet.

452
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,600
I'll kill you.

453
00:42:23,350 --> 00:42:25,190
Yûji! Long time no see!

454
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:28,000
Hi! I'll be over soon.

455
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:32,400
Sorry to keep you waiting.

456
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:38,200
Let's make a toast!

457
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:58,620
<i>Do you feel like you have
a good life?</i>

458
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:02,590
No, I don't.

459
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,100
I'll take you to the station.

460
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:13,170
I'm fine. I told my parents I was
staying at a friend's.

461
00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:16,010
You shouldn't say that.

462
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:23,450
I feel like I can sleep
so easily here.

463
00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:27,920
I'll wake you for the last train.

464
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:48,400
<i>In the end I wasn't able
to tell her the truth.</i>

465
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:51,870
<i>With her relying on me,</i>

466
00:43:51,870 --> 00:43:57,380
<i>I was able to feel better
about myself.</i>

467
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:05,890
<i>At that point I made a vow.</i>

468
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:13,400
<i>I would look after her every
minute of every day.</i>

469
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:29,400
<i>That way she wouldn't
end up like me.</i>

470
